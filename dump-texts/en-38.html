   Hi everyone,
   I have some questions regarding payments via PayPal... Up to now I've
   always refused to accept payments via PayPal, because I'll get charged
   to receive the money. Recently, however, I've turned down quite a lot
   of job offers for precisely this reason and I'm wondering if I should
   change my thinking...

   Hi everyone,
   I have some questions regarding payments via PayPal... Up to now I've
   always refused to accept payments via PayPal, because I'll get charged
   to receive the money. Recently, however, I've turned down quite a lot
   of job offers for precisely this reason and I'm wondering if I should
   change my thinking...
   I'd really like to know why so many agencies prefer to pay via PayPal
   rather than bank transfer - can anyone shed some light on that please?
   All I know is that sending money via PayPal is free and some banks
   charge commission for international transfers (although I've never
   incurred any, neither when sending nor when receiving money). In fact
   an agency in Spain said that they do get charged high rates - so I
   guess every country is different? I really think there must be more
   advantages for the companies sending the money - is it extremely
   time-saving for example? At the moment I can only see the disadvantages
   for me and I'd like to understand both sides of the argument.
   What are your experiences with being paid via PayPal? Do agencies
   generally bear the costs? Could I just add a line to my invoice 'Plus
   1.9% + €0.35 PayPal charges' and have them accept it, no questions
   asked? Are the PayPal charges likely to be lower than bank charges? Or
   if they won't accept the costs could I demand payment within one or two
   weeks? What do you do?
   Thanks very much [icon_smile.gif]
   All the best

   You'll often get charged to receive money by bank transfer as well
                                                          May 5, 2015
   My bank charges $15 USD for incoming wires. For amounts under $500
   Paypal fees are less than my bank fees, and for trivial projects of
   several hundred words it makes no sense to use anything but Paypal.
   It's certainly a much simpler affair to send money by Paypal than by
   bank transfer, even if you can do it through internet banking - there
   are less hurdles to clear, less forms to fill, no bank codes and SWIFT

   redtape; all you typically need is the Paypal email of the receipient,
   enough funds in your Paypal account to cover the transfer, and that's
   all.
   I cover the costs on my own end, whether it's from my bank or from
   Paypal. The invoicing process is bothersome enough without wasting my
   time trying to get savings that come out to below minimum wage when
   time spent is taken into account.

   Sometimes the least bad solution
                        May 5, 2015
   It's instant and requires a lot less administrative work than setting
   up an international wire transfer.
   Transferwise and many other such services are a lot cheaper but don't
   support many countries and still require a lot more work than Paypal.
   The downside is that it's expensive for the translator. I just received
   a payment in USD from India. The fee was over 5 %. If I want it changed
   to euro, it will cost 3 % or more in addition, so we're looking at more

   The downside is that it's expensive for the translator. I just received
   a payment in USD from India. The fee was over 5 %. If I want it changed
   to euro, it will cost 3 % or more in addition, so we're looking at more
   than 8 % in fees. That's about the most expensive service you'll be
   able to find. A payment of for example USD 500 thus costs around USD 40
   in fees, so above a certain amount an alternative to Paypal is likely
   to be better.
   Agencies pay nothing to use Paypal. The translator pays the whole
   party.
   Within the euro zone, SEPA transfer is the obvious solution, as it is
   in most cases free, and it must be credited one day after it is debited
   without deduction of intermediary bank fees. If a Spanish bank charge
   for SEPA transfers, my attitude would be that that is the agency's own
   problem, and they could choose a bank that doesn't. I'm still to come
   across a euro zone bank that charges for online SEPA transfers.
   I also have accounts in two other EU non-euro Member States so I can
   accept transfers in their currencies without charges.
   What fees are concerned, it's a compromise to consider. If the fees
   make the job unprofitable, then I would refuse it. If you can earn
   enough money working for clients that don’t require Paypal, then you
   can turn them down. Otherwise, it's simply a part of normal and
   deductible business expenses. ▲ Collapse

   On budgeting
    May 5, 2015
   Several years ago I was also reluctant to use Paypal, because I did not
   shop online. These days, I use payments received through PayPal for
   online shopping (e.g. small stuff from eBay, etc.) and charity (in most
   cases sick children's parents have a PayPal account, and it's very easy
   and quick to transfer money like this - it literally takes 2 to 3
   minutes). So basically, offering several payment options gave me some

   You need to do whatever is good for your business
                                         May 5, 2015
   It's up to you which payment methods you accept, and in which
   currencies. You may well find that you want to vary your conditions to
   suit individual cases; and use the payment method as a bargaining tool.
   You live in the eurozone, so accepting anything other than euros is not

   cheap as a transfer within the member country (i.e. very often without
   charge), so accepting any other form of payment from eurozone members
   is not perfect. But you need to be as flexible as possible with clients
   who seem to be worth having.
   Personally, I don't allow PayPal payments from eurozone clients unless
   they can give me a good reason, but I'm perfectly happy for clients in
   other parts of the world to use PayPal, as I know that wire transfers
   may cost them dearly and drive them away. But whereas my terms state 30
   days payment for wire transfers, PayPal payers have to pay within 10
   days, or they have to add a 3.5% handling fee (from 11-30 days). I
   accept the equivalent number of US dollars or GB pounds in addition to
   euros, but I won't accept any other currency. My Spanish bank doesn't
   charge commission for receiving USD; my UK bank account is in GBP; and
   my PayPal account has balance streams in EUR and USD (the latter avoids
   conversion as I spend the dollars online) - that's why I'm ready to
   accept these payments.
   You need to decide what you'll accept and why, and make sure there's a
   good business case. ▲ Collapse

   I was to ask this a client in the Eurozone who habitually pays via
   PayPal. Would it cost them to transfer the amount into the Euro account
   at my bank? I don't want to ask them to pay additional fees, but if
   they don't pay a fee it would be cheaper for me.

   SEPA transfers are free in most euro zone banks. However, each bank can
   set their own fees, which then apply to their own account holders. The
   fees for non-domestic SEPA transfers may not be higher than the fees
   for domestic transfers. Payer and beneficiary each pay their own fees
   if any.

   Specially in concern of India, Pay Pal deduction hurts, I am always
   trying to say my clients that please pay extra in Invoice, so I hate
   it... I used only, when have no choice.

   Ask the client to add PayPal fee :)
                           May 5, 2015
   Hi,
   A simple solution would be to ask the client to add a PayPal fee to
   your charges. There are various online fee calculators.
   https://salecalc.com/paypal
   It should typically be 3% + $ 0.3 per transaction (approx.) So, just go
   ahead and ask the client to add this fee, and many would be willing.
   PayPal is reliable. And if you get more than $3000 in a month,... See

   PayPal is reliable. And if you get more than $3000 in a month, you can
   ask for additional discount by contacting PayPal support.
   PayPal is safe since your Bank Details are not revealed, only an email
   id. You can pay using PayPal too, in case you are getting some work
   outsourced.
   A general thumb rule is to use PayPal for small payments and Bank
   Transfer for bigger amount. Most clients too follow this rule. As
   sometimes, it may be more costly to do a wire transfer to someone in
   another continent (if the amount is small). Then PayPal comes to the
   rescue.
   Even refunds are easy with PayPal. Suppose you get a wrong amount, the
   refund can be instant, and without costing a penny.
   Best,

   Don't forget about the conversion rates
                               May 6, 2015
   Colleagues, if you ask the client to bear Paypal charges and the
   transaction involves a currency conversion, keep in mind that Paypal's
   exchange rates are much worse then at most banks, and Paypal only
   allows you to withdraw funds in your local currency.

   No worthwhile alternative, I'm afraid
                             May 6, 2015
   If you are based, say, in Europe and have customers across the ocean,
   PayPal remains the least of the evils.
   Another option is opening a US bank account. The option is interesting
   and some banks are free, but it is not easy and will cost you a lot of
   time.

   Brilliant idea I think, Tom. Not surprised it has not been followed up,
   though. It's all about "scale". And ProZ has relatively small team.
   I find PayPal abusive "feewise" and otherwise. Yet, I am not receiving
   billions of dollars from the States. So I guess I'm just putting up.
   As for the alternatives, I would certainly go for them. The only
   problem is how on earth I can convince my US customers that as of now
   they will have to please, please, use Intuit or Click2Sell. I guess we
   all anticipate the answer.
   The abuse of PayPal comes with its brand name. They were married with
   eBay, but they already filed for divorce. Yet, everybody knows their
   name and therefore everybody is using their services. Sad but true.

   Tom, those alternatives aren't really alternatives

   Here's a quick overview of what those 12 online payment alternatives
   offer for translators:
   Google Wallet
   Works only if both translator and client is in the USA.
   WePay
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Does not offer any information about fees on its site, must "contact
   sales staff" to get that information.
   2checkout.com
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Accepts credit cards, debit cards and PayPal payment
   Client pays nothing
   Translator pays USD 0.45 + 7%
   Translator pays bank currency exchange rate + 5%
   Chargebacks costs the translator USD 25.00
   Authorize.net
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Client pays nothing
   Translator pays USD 49 setup fee
   Translator pays USD 25 monthly fee
   Translator pays USD 0.30 + 4.4%
   Chargeback costs the translator USD 25.00
   No information given about currency exchange fees
   Skrill
   Client pays 1% (max EUR 10)
   Client also pays 1.9% if paying via credit card
   Translator pays no recipient fee
   Translator pays EUR 2.95 withdrawal fee
   Translator pays bank currency exchange rate + 5%
   Translator pays EUR 1 per year if no transactions made in a year
   Intuit
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Client pays nothing
   Translator pays USD 0.25 + 3.4%
   Translator pays 1% if client uses VISA, Mastercard or AMEX
   Translator pays 0.5% if client uses electronic payment
   ProPay
   Appears to be Canada-specific.
   Dwolla
   Works only if translator is in the USA.
   Braintree (a PayPal company, they say)
   Translator must have PayPal business account
   Client pays nothing
   Translator pays EUR 0.30 + 6.8%
   ClickBank
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Stripe
   Aimed at e-commerce, not personal money sending.
   Client pays nothing
   Translator pays EUR 0.30 + 2.9%
   Translator pays bank currency exchange rate + 2%
   Comparing the services is also difficult because not all of them show
   all the fees on their sites. Some of them assume that some fees are not
   "their" fees (but your and your client's bank's fees) and therefore
   don't state it on the site. Some of them don't mention their currency
   exchange rate surcharges (so it's easy to forget to take those into
   account).
   So, essentially, there is only PayPal and Skrill. Skrill is cheaper
   (even if you tell your client that he can deduct the Skrill fee off
   your invoice) but does not work in the USA.
   Other options for money sending include:
   * Western Union (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money
   in person, can take several days for transfer)
   * Moneygram (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money in
   person, can take several days for transfer)
   * WorldRemit (somewhat limited number of country-to-country
   combinations, USD 4 per transaction)
   * Xoom (limited number of countries, client pays USD 5.00)
   * Transferwise (essentially this is a normal bank transfer, with
   reduced currency exchange fees)

     * [26]Praise

   Parents everywhere want their children to be happy and do well. Yet how
   parents seek to achieve this ambition varies enormously. For instance,
   American and Chinese parents are increasingly authoritative and
   authoritarian, whereas Scandinavian parents tend to be more permissive.
   Why? Love, Money, and Parenting investigates how economic forces and
   growing inequality shape how parents raise their children. From
   medieval times to the present, and from the United States, the United
   Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden to China and Japan, Matthias
   Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how economic incentives and
   constraints—such as money, knowledge, and time—influence parenting
   practices and what is considered good parenting in different countries.
   Through personal anecdotes and original research, Doepke and Zilibotti
   show that in countries with increasing economic inequality, such as the
   United States, parents push harder to ensure their children have a path
   to security and success. Economics has transformed the hands-off
   parenting of the 1960s and ’70s into a frantic, overscheduled activity.
   Growing inequality has also resulted in an increasing “parenting gap”
   between richer and poorer families, raising the disturbing prospect of
   diminished social mobility and fewer opportunities for children from
   disadvantaged backgrounds. In nations with less economic inequality,
   such as Sweden, the stakes are less high, and social mobility is not
   under threat. Doepke and Zilibotti discuss how investments in early
   childhood development and the design of education systems factor into
   the parenting equation, and how economics can help shape policies that
   will contribute to the ideal of equal opportunity for all.
   Love, Money, and Parenting presents an engrossing look at the economics
   of the family in the modern world.

Awards and Recognition

     * A Fatherly Top Ten Best Parenting Book of the Decade
     * A Choice Outstanding Academic Title of the Year

   Matthias Doepke is professor of economics at Northwestern University.
   He lives in Evanston, Illinois. Fabrizio Zilibotti is the Tuntex
   Professor of International and Development Economics at Yale
   University. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.

   "Psychologists, sociologists and journalists have spent more than a
   decade diagnosing and critiquing the habits of ‘helicopter parents’ and
   their school obsessions. . . . But new research shows that in our
   unequal era, this kind of parenting is essential. That’s the message of
   the book Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We
   Raise Our Kids, by the economists Matthias Doepke of Northwestern
   University and Fabrizio Zilibotti of Yale. It’s true that high-octane,
   hardworking child-rearing has some pointless excesses, and it doesn’t
   spark joy for parents. But done right, it works for kids, not just in
   the United States but in rich countries around the world."—Pamela
   Druckerman, New York Times

   "An incisive look at parenting and economic inequality."—Carolyn Dever,
   Public Books

   "Why do so many seemingly sane people get over-involved with their
   kids? The answer is not that parents have collectively come unhinged,
   according to the new book Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics
   Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids. Rather, parents today are rational
   economic actors responding to an increasingly unhinged
   environment."—Jenny Anderson, Quartz

   "An earnest tilt at a genuinely hard question: To what degree are
   parental choices informed by economic realities? Reducing his answer to
   a single line is reductive, but let’s do it anyway. When it comes to
   raising Americans kids, it’s the economy, stupid."—Patrick A. Coleman,
   Fatherly.com

   "As economists Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti reveal in their
   recent book Love, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way
   We Raise Our Kids, today’s American parents are not so crazy after all.
   For better and worse, their parenting style is perfectly rational."—Kay
   Hymowitz, Institute for Family Studies

   "All in all, a highly informative read."—David Lorimer, Paradigm
   Explorer

   "The book introduces stimulating ideas in an accessible manner."—John
   Ermisch, Journal of Economic Inequality

   "N/A"—Alexandra Martynenko, Antropologicheskij Forum

   “Love, Money, and Parenting presents a fascinating, insightful analysis
   of the origins and consequences of different parenting styles over time
   and place. Doepke and Zilibotti explain how and why parents shape child
   preferences and skills to adapt their offspring to the anticipated
   social and economic realities facing them as adults. The authors
   creatively use basic economic theory to integrate and interpret a vast
   body of evidence from multiple disciplines. This ambitious, well-argued
   book carefully examines how families influence the social and economic
   fortunes of their children.”—James J. Heckman, Nobel Laureate in
   Economics

   “Economics is usually the last thing on people's minds when they think
   about parenting. This wonderfully readable and original book aims to
   change that. It shows how different parenting styles are all about
   trade-offs, how they shape the way children explore and experiment with
   the world and take risks, and how economic factors have played an
   important role in the striking changes we have experienced in the way
   parents think about their children and parent them. A must-read.”—Daron
   Acemoglu, coauthor of Why Nations Fail

   “In their stimulating account of the reasons behind different parenting
   practices, Doepke and Zilibotti unashamedly argue for an economic
   interpretation, while also including social and cultural factors.
   Worryingly, the authors show how emerging societal divisions could
   enable some parents to promote their children even as they disable the
   efforts of parents in more difficult economic circumstances. Parenting
   regimes by class threaten equal opportunities, social mobility, and
   political participation. The authors’ hope is that thoughtful policy
   interventions can head off such threats.” —Jane Humphries, author of
   Childhood and Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution

   “Presenting many key findings and novel explanations, Love, Money, and
   Parenting argues that we can use economic principles to explain why
   different parenting styles exist across different countries and within
   countries at any given point in time. At once intelligent,
   sophisticated, and accessible, there is no other book that tackles the
   same themes as this one. I really enjoyed reading it.”—Nattavudh
   Powdthavee, author of The Happiness Equation

   “Bringing together personal experiences, reasoning, and evidence, this
   fascinating and persuasive book shows that parenting decisions are
   governed by incentives and an economic approach can help us to
   understand why parents’ choices might vary across countries and over
   time. The wealth of information, detail, and strength of economic
   argument is impressive.”—Jo Blanden, coauthor of The Persistence of
   Poverty across Generations

Who has a side gig/job that brings in extra cash?? Share with us!

   « on: July 26, 2013, 10:34:33 AM »
   At one time I was a journeyman plumber, so I still bring in some extra
   $ with that, but I'm interested in other side jobs, or creative gigs
   that any of you take advantage of.
   Let's here em'

   This is certainly unique, but I make handmade 18th and 19th century
   hats and bonnets for reenactors, museums, even an opera company once!
   Obviously the market is small and you have to have considerable sewing
   skills, but it brings in some decent $.  $400/month for July, though
   that is higher than usual.
   I've been thrilled with my ability to turn a craft/hobby into
   meaningful income!  And there are plenty of quilters, seamstresses, etc
   who have little side hustles on Etsy.

   Refereeing sports. I make $40-$60 per game doing teenage soccer. You
   can be as casual as a game here and there or as intense as a tournament
   with 6-8 games per day for 3 days over a holiday weekend. Getting
   qualified is a matter of completing a weekend course. They're always
   begging for more refs.
   Must have a thick skin and enjoy running about in the park! I tell
   everyone I can about this side gig because making 45 bucks watching 14
   year old girls (they rarely foul each other) have fun outside on a
   sunny afternoon is like stealing money.

   I work at an auto parts store on the weekends. It started off as a
   summer job in college. I worked full time during the summers and part
   time during the semesters. I just continued working there even after I
   graduated. I enjoy it, it puts extra money in my pocket, and I get a
   really big discount on parts, which I've used countless times and has
   saved me thousands of dollars.

   i'm a full time physician so not a whole lot of extra time but...
   i opened a mechanic shop and had my mechanic friend (who became my
   partner) run it for a while...
   made some money but i reinvested a lot of it too...
   it was good because he pretty much ran it and i did all the book
   keeping, financing etc...
   i was on fiverr.com for a while and it wasn't too bad but needed a lot
   of my time and make $10-30 per month...
   i started buying some car parts on craigslist and car forums for cheap
   and would sell them on ebay...
   again time consuming...
   i did this more when i was in med school...
   in college i went around computer shops and asked them for the parts
   they didn't need (old hard drives etc)...
   and would get all the info, make a nice posting and sell on ebay....
   that actually was really good money....

   My hourly wage is laughable- I tend to make about $5/hr on my labor,
   but it is improving.   That said, I do this while I am sitting in front
   of the TV, so it is time that would otherwise be wasted.  Also, I just
   really enjoy doing it, so it doesn't seem like work for me!
   For my pricing,  I looked at what was out in the marketplace that was
   similar (admittedly it is a small marketplace) and used that as a
   guide.  I'll add more for a more elaborate design or expensive
   materials or if it has some feature that increases the labor.   I could
   probably charge more, but I feel like I am getting a fair amount.

   Waitressing.
   I'm glad I have this skill to fall back on in case I get laid off. But
   I plan on quitting when I pay off my loans and then hopefully I'll find
   something different - like making things - to bring in some extra cash.

   IMO: If you have a hobby you enjoy and someone pays for your raw
   materials and you come out at $0 an hour: you come out ahead.

   My feelings exactly!  I would do this for free, so the money is like a
   super bonus!

   Flipping items. Anything from cars, to car parts, to unique antiques.
   It's a lot of fun finding a deal and turning a profit. For example I
   found a really cool typewriter at Goodwill for $3. Looked it up and
   found it to be collectable after I bought it. Sold it on CL for $120.
   Anything vintage is a great investment.

   I'm a web developer by trade and did some on the side consulting for
   about a year before I got burnt out. Wasn't a fan of 60-65 hour work
   weeks  and my friends harassing me for never being available on the
   weekends. It's not like I NEEDED the extra money.
   Since then I've been building and redesigning/updating websites for
   small businesses in the area, mostly for people I know. I typically do
   any side projects during the winter - I hate being stuck inside in the
   summer. After all, we only get 2-3 months of nice weather here in MN!

   I do photography on the side and shoot family/couples. I charge $250
   for a session and make quite a bit more on prints. It makes a decent
   side income and its something I love doing. My day job is a software
   engineer.

   I was working a side job at a gym, low pay, but got paid to exercise!
   I will probably go back to it a few nights a week when I move back to
   the area (hopefully soon).

   i can't remember exactly, but i think it's between 15-20,000 words.
   it's 10 chapters long, and each chapter is 1500-2000 words. comes out
   to 45 pages as assessed by the kindle store.
   i priced it low -- $2.99 -- figuring that it will be at least as
   entertaining and useful as a cup of coffee.

   I flip vintage collectibles (mainly clothing, housewares, decor, some
   books) in various venues, mostly online. I've been doing it on and off
   for 12 years. I only do about $1000/year now - but when I started out,
   I had a low-paying entry-level job in my field, and the extra cash
   covered most of my grad school tuition. But it was a lot of work and I
   probably didn't crack $10/hour - I had more time than money back then.
   Nowadays I only do it if I happen to run across something and I think I
   can make at least $50 without much effort. Those opportunities are
   pretty scarce in the niche markets I know well. If I wanted to ramp up
   my side gig I'd plan to expand into other niche antiques/collectibles
   areas.

   I used to make money playing online Poker, but soon after I quit I
   believe it became illegal.  Ended up being 8-10 dollars an hour profit,
   but it wasn't good for my mood.

   I work in law enforcement/forensics but will be teaching a night class
   at the local university this fall for an extra $5000/semester. If it
   works out, I will try to pick up another class for the spring or summer
   - or maybe do one online.

   I run an ebay store that earns me about $1000 profit/month & that is
   after I pay someone else to most of the work. So, all in all a pretty
   good side gig that I could ramp up with more free time.

   I rent out my basement apartment on Airbnb. It requires maybe 20 hours
   of work per month (cleaning, communicating with guests, etc.). It
   brings in about 1,800 per month in income, some of which is used to
   cover elevated utility costs, paper product costs, etc. Still a pretty
   profitable side gig, and we've also met a lot of cool people too.

   I have been thinking about teaching part-time in the evenings, too.
   Problem is I think $5000/semester is a lot more than I would get... :)

   I sell books on Amazon. I buy them at the Goodwill for $1 or $2, then
   list them and send 'em off when they sell. The best one I found was a
   book on internal combustion mechanics that I bought for $2 and sold for
   $125.
   The husband is the one who really rakes it in with the side gigs. He
   plays drums in a local swing band and makes at least $60 per show.
   However, if he could convince himself that he's good enough at the
   bagpipes, he could hire himself out as a bagpiper for weddings and
   funerals for $250 a pop. (He's a perfectionist, though, and is never
   pleased with how he plays.)

     I rent out my basement apartment on Airbnb. It requires maybe 20
     hours of work per month (cleaning, communicating with guests, etc.).
     It brings in about 1,800 per month in income, some of which is used
     to cover elevated utility costs, paper product costs, etc. Still a
     pretty profitable side gig, and we've also met a lot of cool people
     too.

     WOW!  Where do you live that you get that much demand?

   I live in Chicago. Hotels are so expensive here; there's a lot of
   demand for affordable temporary housing. :)

   My husband and I have day jobs that are often freelanced, so we can do
   very similar work as contractors when we want extra cash. Freelance
   editing and freelance graphic design.

   After fixing my dryer myself, and reading people doing it full time, I
   thought about doing it on weekends but I don't have a truck/space to
   store it (excuses I know...)
   But for about a $10-100 parts and about 30 minutes to take apart and
   clean, you can resell them for about $100-200 fairly easy on craigslist
   in my area. And pick up free "broken" ones on craigslist as well.
   Another thing is doing a tuneup on cars (spark plugs and wires only)
   and charge $100 for it. I know someone that does this on the weekends,
   takes a $30 kit for both plugs and wires, and 15 minutes to change out.
   He does the rest of the auto mechanic work (switch out timing
   belt/water pump, etc) but I don't have the tools, hours for something
   that takes 4-5 hours to do. The spark plugs/wires I can do though :). I
   just have to advertize myself for it but I don't really put much effort
   into it. Maybe 1-2 cars a month? I get decent responses because I offer
   to drive to their house and do it in their driveway (something other
   people don't seem to do and I don't see any reason not to, I'm getting
   3-4x the parts price so I can afford gas/bike).

   I have just fallen into a side gig every Christmas.  I'm a good
   shopper, and I recognize a deal when I see one.  I have usually
   financed my family's Christmas by selling deals I find on ebay or local
   classifieds.  Last year, I bought Sorel boots at a Columbia factory
   outlet store- I bought every pair between a size 6 and 11.  They cost
   me $16/pr with discounts, and I sold them all on eBay for $60/pr.  They
   retailed for $120, so it was a win/win.  A couple years ago, it was
   XBOX's.  I found a deal that included gift cards, then rolled the gift
   cards into the next XBOX purchase.  In years past, I've also bought and
   sold Wii's and American Girl dolls.  I never intend to do it.  It's
   just something I'm trying to find a deal on.  Then I start doing the
   math and somehow I get sucked back into it.

   I'm a sysadmin, so I do IT work on the side for individuals and very
   small businesses,  At $50 an hour I'm pretty happy, and I know I could
   make and charge more if I were to really push it, but I am a very busy
   person already so I usually let the work find me.   If I were young and
   single and didn't want to work for "the man"???  There is good money
   here, certainly qualifies for one of those 50K+ jobs without a degree
   that MMM recently posted about.  If I were out of work I am confident I
   could fall back on this.

   I do a couple wedding dj gigs a year, mostly for friends or friends of
   friends.  I've got a basic sound system and a laptop full of hits (most
   of them ripped from library cds), and that's all it takes to get
   started.  Every time I do one I upgrade my gear a little bit with the
   proceeds.

   I have a teaching license, so I was able to get a very part time
   teaching job at night.  I teach adult immigrants how to read English.
   It's about five hours a week, and I take home an extra $500 a month.
   It's super easy and fun!  Definitely a fun side gig.

   I dont have a side gig but really want one.  In the past i sold coupons
   on ebay....woulg get them out of recycling dumpsters and make around
   300 per month. Also did online poker which cleared at least a few
   hundred on average but it has become too saturated. Lots of ideas, i
   just have to  focus and make one of these work:
   Resell sports jerseys....buy from china, sell on craigs. Likely $30
   profit per item
   Poker in casinos
   Dog walker
   Do taxes or books on the side (im an accountant)
   House sitting
   Pet boarding
   House cleaning although people are reluctant to hire males
   Driving instructor
   Get an actual part time job

   I make about $1000 every holiday season by offering gift-wrapping
   service.
   They provide their own papers, decorations & consumables (tape), I show
   up with my toolbox (good scissors etc) and do everything they have in 1
   trip. I charge $3.50 per gift big or small and prefer to make only one
   trip to wrap everything (I work at their house).
   When I started I had a classified ad, now I have enough
   referrals/regulars to stay as busy as I would like to be during the
   season. Average job is about 4-5 hours and 30-40 gifts.
   I find a perverse satisfaction in making money from other people's
   consumerism LOL.

   This is more passive income -- but I rent our 1/2 my two car garage to
   a contractor to store his tools. It's $100/month - and he's been
   renting it for over 5 years... So it's worked out well for me.
   I've considered learning how to do calligraphy (I've wanted to learn
   just for fun anyway) and then offer to invitations, etc... but haven't
   started that yet - has anyone else done this or know anything about it
   as a side gig?

   Buying extra tickets for concerts that I am confident that will sell
   out. We don't actively pursue this, but we easily make a few hundred a
   month doing that. Probably could make $2k a month if we put effort into
   it.
   The last few years I have helped start up some businesses with friends
   and acquaintances. Usually that is a six figure side gig. I have kept
   the stock and make about $30k a year in semi passive income for a few
   hours a month for board meeting, meetings with bankers, etc.
   Managing the balance sheet, by refinancing debt to low interest rates,
   buying rentals, managing investments adds up to tens of thousands. The
   refinance of the mortgage over 10 years saved like $50k in interest.
   Keeping eyes and ears open for good deals. It is mostly just simple
   math and the initiative to do it.
   A friend buys up land with timber.  He typically is dealing with
   uneducated people who need money fast and have no clue of  the value of
   the timber. He can buy the land for $40k cash, thin the land and get
   $50k in timber and then subdivide the land. This is not his full time
   job, he just started doing it as a side project.

   I have down a lot of side gigs in my life.  Currently I have a few
   people that I dog sit for.  I either watch the dogs at my house or stay
   at their house when they are away, if they want me to take care of
   other things while they are away.  It's pretty easy money, and I
   usually bring in about an additional 200.00 a year.  It's not a huge
   amount, but something I enjoy.
   I also played baseball in college, and was giving private baseball
   lessons.  I had all my own equipment, from batting tees, to catchers
   equipment, hundreds of balls etc.  At one time I was giving lessons to
   three different kids making an extra 150.00 or so a week.  It was fun,
   but then I got nervous about a kid getting injured, and getting sued.
   I stopped as my clients got older.
   When I was a teenager, I used to mow lawns.  I had about 4 in my
   neighborhood.  Most of my current neighbors pay about 100.00 for
   professional lawn services.  I have been thinking about getting back
   into lawn care again, and charging 75. LOL

   Since I buy a decent amount of art from local artists, I've been
   spending a ton on professional framing.  I just signed up for a lesson
   ($50, including equipment) so I can learn to mat and frame myself.
   Assuming I pick it up reasonably well, I'm thinking it will be a decent
   side hustle.  I don't imagine it will bring in big bucks, but I think
   it will make something.  I've been struggling to come up with a side
   gig that I can do for many years and scale up and down as needed, so
   I'm pretty pleased about this.  Fingers crossed...

   Although due to time I don't do much of it now but...
   IT support/setup/installs for small business or personal.  Generally
   charge about $45/hr.  I stopped doing this due to time and not wanting
   to work on IT during weekends.
   Tennis Coaching, although I'm not certified yet... playing at the club
   I get strangers approach me and ask me to teach lessons to their
   kids... I do and charge about $25/hr (could be more but heck, i'm
   having fun too!).  I'll be certified once I'm FI.
   Also not for all and probably frowned upon by this crowed, I play
   online and live poker.  It takes a lot of emotional control, bit of
   mathematics, bit of deductive reasoning and a lot of gamble :)... but
   generally the more skilled player wins long term.  Been playing for
   about 8yrs now, majority of our current rental condo down payment was
   by a tournament win, about 25k.

   Great to see everyone's response.
   My wife decided to submit her picture to be an "extra" at TV
   commercials and TV shows.  Perfect for opportunities during days off
   and you do have the option to either accept or not the opportunities
   she is offered.
   - If selected, averages approx $75- $250/day (typically 5-8 hours)  at
   one point there was one for $800/day (depending on client budget)
   - No skills needed other than wait for you to be called on and be a
   background for a commercial.
   - They usually feed you on the set.
   We've used this as extra incoming which 80% goes straight to savings.
   *This did require a 1 time fee to be in the agency database.  The wife
   got that fee back on her first gig.

   shut down internet poker in the US) the fields have gotten

   As far as casino poker, I'd recommend building your bankroll up as
   quickly as possible to get out of 1/2 NLHE - the rake is too high and
   eats up your profit. 2/5 and up is probably best.
   In my opinion, poker is the most fun I've ever had making money! If you
   can do it - more power to you!
   I currently make my living as a gaming consultant and poker tournament
   player :-)

   1. I coach kids' gymnastics a few evenings a week. It's fun and a lot
   of the time I work out afterwards.
   2. I buy stuff (usually niche things I'm very familiar with) at the
   thrift store and re-sell it on ebay for quite a bit more than I paid
   3. I play bagpipes at weddings/funerals/events. maryofdoom, I may have
   actually met your husband if you're in the Southwest PA area, that's
   where I am, too!

   It sucks, we don't have much 2/5+ here, it's all either 1/2 or 1/3.
   But the 1/2 has a $300 max buyin so you are a little deeper.
   I'm working on my game now.  I have not had a very good year.  I took
   $10K out of my bankroll when I bought a house, leaving me with $5K
   left.  I finally realized I was playing to not lose instead of playing
   to win.  I was a pretty weak-tight player to begin with who was a
   little profitable.
   Good thing, is now I have recognized that and have been reading
   advanced texts and have been starting to play a more aggressive game.
   Too early to tell, yet.  Hoping this will bring my win rate up.
   Increasing my bluffing and stealing and just trying to play the players
   better instead of playing the cards.

   I buy and sell antiques and widgets for a healthy profit (About 750 in
   the last month) Currently I am preparing to start a side business of
   handyman services and/or computer repair for some additional income.
   Shooting for 35/hour with a 2 hour minimum
   The person with cash in their pocket can always make a deal.

     I sell books on Amazon. I buy them at the Goodwill for $1 or $2,
     then list them and send 'em off when they sell. The best one I found
     was a book on internal combustion mechanics that I bought for $2 and
     sold for $125.

   This sounds interesting, and dare I say it, pretty easy (as long as
   you've got storage space, have patience, and can organize your books
   easily and efficiently).  How much do you make in a normal month?

[XBTF]Questions about making money

   Post by N4N » Sun, 1. Sep 13, 22:40
   I created an ore mine in Profit share(I dont even know why, since there
   is one already here.....anyway) but its running out of Energy cells all
   the time, I put cash into the station and I bring the cells myself, but
   nobody stop and sells cells to station and by the way nobody come to
   buy the ORE, even if I put low price to the stuff.
   Any way I can make a ship transport energy cells there? A cheap way,
   because I dont think I can afford to buy a ship. I have serious
   problems making money here, takes me lot of runs thru many stations,
   buying and selling to do few thousands, I dont think I can buy
   expensive staff such as mineral scanner or trading system extension,
   since I barelly have money for myself.
   Any early game making money tips?

   As long as you have money to buy energy cells, you can buy or use a
   current ship to buy for your station.
   The ship or fighter needs Trade 1 and 2 installed and supply software.
   Goto ships command menu.
   Select choose home-base.
   When map appears find and target your base.
   Go to top of command menu.
   Select Buy wares for best price.
   Select Energy cells
   The ship will automatically seek out and buy for energy.
   If the station is full the ship will wait until the station needs more
   energy then set off again to buy.
   A fighter can also be used as Energy cells are a small ware.

   yeah well, that's in other games, such as X3, but Im in X beyond the
   frontier, and there is no such thing as ship comands menu...

   In BTF you purchase transport ships and give them orders via the
   station menu--if you land at your ore mine you'll see an option to buy
   transport ships. However, I'm pretty sure those ships are limited to
   only buying resources the station needs, it's not possible to set them
   to automatically sell its products.
   However, you can pretty much always make money on stations in BTF
   because of the way the pricing structure is laid out--even if you set
   your ore to sell at the lowest possible price (to undercut the
   competition), you can still make a profit.

   oh lord, so you buy ships from stations......no wonder I couldnt find
   any at shipyards,.... :evil: I thought they didnt want to sell to me
   because of low rank, but now I understand why.....
   Thanks a lot, as usual ;)
   By the way, I couldnt see any rank list anywhere, is there rank in
   XBTF? Also to be honest, the lack of proper menu system, is
   troublesome, I even miss the "ugly" Reunion menu system :P

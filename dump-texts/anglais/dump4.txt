   The federal agency that administers Social Security benefits is making
   new efforts to reclaim overpayments, and it may try to claw back money
   if you’ve been receiving too much.

   About 1 million people per year received overpayment notices from the
   Social Security Administration (SSA) in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years,
   Kilolo Kijakazi, acting commissioner of the SSA, said in recent
   testimony to Congresss. The agency began a "top-to-bottom" [176]review
   of overpayment issues last month, Kijakazi said.

   Roughly 0.5% of Social Security payments are overpayments, according to
   the agency. Overpayments can either be the government’s fault or the
   result of a mistake by the beneficiary. Either way, the result is that
   beneficiaries owe money back to the government.

   A new [177]60 Minutes report found that some overpaid Social Security
   recipients have been told they need to pay back tens of thousands of
   dollars. For example, a 73-year-old woman told the program she was
   notified that she owed $72,000 in overpayments because her benefits
   were based on incorrect salary information.

Government to track down Social Security overpayments

   It is unclear how much money the government is trying to collect in
   Social Security overpayments. Officials denied that the agency is
   trying to collect $21 billion in Social Security overpayments, as some
   media reports suggested.

   "This figure was derived from the total amount of overpayments that
   have occurred over the history of the programs," the SSA explained in a
   [179]statement last month. "Each person’s situation is unique, and the
   agency handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis."

   The news of the overpayment review could be concerning for Social
   Security beneficiaries who are unsure if they are being paid the
   correct amount — or for anyone who suspects their checks are larger
   than they should be.

   The SSA said the overpayment problem occurs "given the number of people
   the agency serves, the number of changes in their circumstances and the
   complexity of the program."[DEL: :DEL]

   The SSA collected $4.7 billion in overpaid Social Security in 2022, per
   an inspector general report. (The agency notes that Social Security
   benefits total $1.4 trillion per year.)

   Social Security benefits help supplement income in retirement for 70
   million recipients. The annual [180]cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)
   was 8.7% in 2023 based on high inflation, bringing benefits to about
   $1,700 per month on average. Another [181]3.2% increase in payments is
   slated for 2024.

What happens if you were paid too much in Social Security

   If you've been overpaid, it's possible to get on a plan to repay the
   government gradually. However, according to [182]KFF Health News, these
   plans are stressing the budgets of some affected beneficiaries as the
   agency is collecting from "poor, retired, and disabled people who have
   spent the money and are unable to repay it."

   When someone is overpaid Social Security, years could pass before the
   issue is detected, and by that time the mistake may have amounted to a
   massive sum, according to the health news publication.

   The government is required by law to try to recover Social Security
   overpayments, officials said, but recovery can be waived in some
   scenarios.

   You can file an appeal or make a request that the Social Security
   Administration not seek the money back. The agency also said it’s
   working to reduce overpayments in the future and make relief more
   accessible to overpaid beneficiaries seeking waivers.

How to avoid Social Security overpayments

   Experts are encouraging Social Security beneficiaries to calculate how
   much they should be getting paid to see if it aligns with their
   benefits. Doing this calculation can reduce the chances of a surprise
   overpayment notice from the SSA.

   The AARP has an online tool that can help you [183]estimate your
   benefits. You can also access your [184]"my Social Security" account to
   check if the information the agency has on file is accurate. Benefits
   are partially based on the Social Security taxes you've paid in your
   lifetime, so it's important to make sure the earnings history is
   accurate.

   If you have a government pension, your Social Security benefits can be
   more complicated to calculate. According to 60 Minutes, there's a risk
   of overpayment if you don't properly report your pension information to
   Social Security.

   Working disabled people should also be aware of the income limit for
   Social Security, which is $1,470 per month in most cases. Overpayments
   can be avoided by promptly notifying the SSA of changes in your
   employment or your income.

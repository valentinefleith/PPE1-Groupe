Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

   Published on:

   26 April 2023

   The Money and Pensions Service has produced a new guide that shows
   creditors how to offer more support to customers living with a mental
   health problem. Living with a mental health problem can make it more
   difficult to interact with and manage money, including payments to
   financial services providers, public sector creditors and utility
   providers.

     * [62]Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

How the Mental Health and Money guide was created

   ‘Mental Health and Money’ was created after detailed consultation with
   experts in both financial wellbeing and mental health.

   The guidance is supported by the Money and Mental Health Policy
   Institute, Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and Citizens Advice, along with
   Adferiad Recovery in Wales, MindWise in Northern Ireland and Scottish
   organisations Change Mental Health and Citizens Advice Scotland.

Why money matters in mental health

   Money and mental health are strongly linked, with research from the
   Money and Mental Health Policy Institute showing one in five people
   (18%) living with a mental health problem are also in problem debt.

   However, we also know that there is a lot of information out there
   about what organisations should do to best support their customers, and
   it may be difficult to know where to start.
   [64]Back to top

What the guide offers

   The guide outlines six ways in which creditors in financial services,
   utilities and the public sector can do more to support those who are
   struggling.

   These include equipping staff to help, extra consideration when chasing
   payments and making it easier for people to get in touch when they need
   help.

   Others include allowing affected customers to involve third parties in
   managing their account, more forbearance and proactively referring them
   to external support.

   The guide also suggests how creditors can put the techniques into
   practice, lists resources they can use and reminds them of the relevant
   FCA duties that may require it.

Money transfer

   Hello, I have some saving accounts in France and I do have to fill up a
   self assessment in order to pay my taxes on the interests in the UK. If
   I wanted to transfer some money from my French bank account to my
   English bank account, do I have to declare or mention it somewhere?
   Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of money I am transferring to
   the Uk? And what is the maximum amount I can transfer in one go? Thank
   you

   Hi,
   In terms of income tax this would not need to be declared.
   We would only look to tax interest from a bank account, and this has
   already been declared.
   In terms of how much you can tranfer, you would need to speak to your
   bank regarding this.

   I have similar issue, transferred a loan from my business account (
   sole trader not limited) to my personal. Do it affect my self assesment
   next year? Thanks

   Hi,
   Where your business loan is kept will not affect any tax return unless
   you accrue interest on it. In which case you will need to declare this
   to us.

   I’m a Canadian citizen, resident in the UK and wish to transfer monies
   from Canada to the UK. The money was left to me by my late mother and
   relevant taxes have been paid in Canada. It’s not income so I can’t see
   that I’d need to pay income tax on the UK on it ? Would this be correct
   please ? Thanks in advance. Joe.

   Hello.
   There are no income tax implications with you moving Capital from one
   bank to another.
   The interest you receive from the accounts are taxable income.
   Thank You.

   I am an international student (Taiwanese) who has already lived in the
   UK for two years. I would like to buy a house in the UK for my
   university journey, my father’s ex-business partner is willing to lend
   me around £400K (interest-free) from Singapore. Before receiving £400K
   from Singapore, I would like to ask some questions and hope somebody
   can give me some suggestions: (1) As a non-UK citizen, could I use the
   borrowed money for the property purchase? (cash buyer) (2) If I can use
   the borrowed money for the property purchase, do I need to declare the
   large money transaction with HMRC? Like tax paying. Big thanks

   Hi, I am a Malaysian and will move to UK soon to star a new job. I have
   never worked in UK before and all my current savings are from prior
   work in other countries with income tax paid and tax filing done. Do I
   need to declare such transfer with HMRC and will it be subject for any
   tax? Thank you!

   Hello Xiang Li.

   For income tax purposes, you do not need to  notify us of your Capital
   your bank account or if you transfer your money to a UK account.
   Thank You.

   Good morning. My father who has a savings account in one UK bank is
   planning on transfering money to my account in another UK bank, and
   neither of these accounts are joint accounts (I am not in his accound
   and he is not in mine). Will he or myself have to pay any taxes on that
   transfer? If so, is there a limit in the money transfered above which I
   will get taxed? Thanks for your help in advance.

   Hello - I moved to the UK just over five months ago. I've been renting
   an apartment with my wife and children since November. And working for
   a UK-based company since Oct. I have money held in a foreign account
   and would like to transfer the sums into my UK accounts. Do I need to
   notify HMRC about this transfer? This is money I have saved from
   previous jobs before moving to the UK. Thank you.

   Hi taimmah,
   There is no income tax implications when you change capital from one
   bank account to another.
   You may wish to check with the overseas tax authorities if  you need to
   notify them and you may wish to contact your bank to check if any
   deails are needed there.
   Thank you.

   Hello, I am just arrived at the UK. I am arranging to move money from
   my overseas accounts to the UK. Part of the money moving in will be
   used towards the purchase of a residential house for my son in the UK.
   He is currently a non-resident and will be a tax-resident in the year
   2021-2022. Need my son or I pay UK tax for the money transfer? Does it
   require for any declaration of the transfer to the HMRC? Will there be
   any difference if the money transfer between our accounts (UK accounts)
   occur before and after financial year cut-off of 5April2021? Thank you.

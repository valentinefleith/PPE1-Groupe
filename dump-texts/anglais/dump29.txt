Money Services Business Definition

   The term "money services business" includes any [37]person doing
   business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business
   concern, in one or more of the following capacities:

   (1) Currency dealer or exchanger.
   (2) Check casher.
   (3) Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.
   (4) Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored
   value.
   (5) Money transmitter.
   (6) U.S. Postal Service.

   An activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per person per day in one
   or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or
   exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or
   stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers' checks, money orders
   or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity --
   if the threshold is not met for the specific activity,
   the [38]person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of
   that activity.

   No activity threshold applies to the definition of money transmitter.
   Thus, a person who engages as a business in the transfer of funds is an
   MSB as a money transmitter, regardless of the amount of money
   transmission activity.

   Notwithstanding the previous discussion, the term "money services
   business" does not include:
     * A bank, as that term is defined in 31 CFR 1010.100(d) (formerly 31
       CFR 103.11(c)), or
     * A person registered with, and regulated or examined by, the
       Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
       Commission.

   For the complete regulatory definition of "money services business",
   see 31 CFR 1010.100(ff) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(uu)).

   Note: Each money services business (MSB) is a [39]financial
   institution. For the regulatory definition of "financial institution,"
   see 31 CFR 1010.100(t) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(n)).

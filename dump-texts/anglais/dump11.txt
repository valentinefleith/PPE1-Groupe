How to talk to your children about money

   Children who are better with money tend to have learnt these skills
   from their parents or carers. Giving your child the opportunity to
   spend and save from an early age allows them to develop the skills they
   need to make good choices about money now and in the future.

What’s in this guide

     * [206]Talking to children about money can be difficult
     * [207]It’s easier than you think
     * [208]Start when your child is still young
     * [209]You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money
     * [210]A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   As a parent or carer, you are the most important influence on your
   child’s attitude to money. And you can help them to learn the essential
   skills they’ll use to manage money throughout their lives.

   We’ll show you how to help 3 to 11 year olds understand:
     * where money comes from and what you use it for
     * how to make good choices and learn from their mistakes
     * the benefits of saving
     * how to make choices about what to buy with the money they have
     * the difference between wants and needs.

   Supporting your child to build a healthy relationship with money
   doesn’t happen overnight. Talking openly and practising in real life
   will help your child to pick up the skills they need.

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

It’s never too early to talk money

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

   We want our children to grow up feeling confident about managing money.
   However, it’s often difficult to talk about money – it can be an
   emotional topic, especially if you have had your own issues with it or
   feel you would say the wrong thing.


   You may feel that money discussions are better left until your child is
   older. But this can stop them from developing the skills they need to
   look after their money in the long term.
   [211]Back to top

It’s easier than you think

   The good news is you don’t have to manage your own money perfectly to
   be able to teach your children good habits. You just need to decide
   what you want to teach them and keep it simple.

   Little and often is the best approach. Doing fun activities together
   also helps them to learn through real-life experiences. Making these
   conversations and activities a part of daily life will teach your
   children the skills they need.
   [212]Back to top

Start when your child is still young

   Our habits around money can start to form from around the age of seven.
   This includes whether you spend money straight away or like to save up.
   Children learn not just from what you tell them but from what they see
   you doing, so starting early helps to build good habits.

   There’s no reason not to talk to your kids about money from as young as
   three years old.

   This will help them:
     * Get the practice they need – learning how to manage money doesn’t
       happen overnight. Children need to build up their knowledge over
       time. They learn by taking lots of small steps and having
       opportunities to use money in real life.
     * Learn from their mistakes – this helps them to understand the
       consequences of the decisions they make. For example, if they spend
       all their money on sweets and can’t afford a new toy, they’re
       learning reasons to save but in a situation where the stakes are
       low.
     * Avoid money problems in the future – if you only start managing
       money when you’re an adult, the decisions you need to make usually
       involve bigger sums of money so the consequences of mistakes can be
       more severe.

   [213]Back to top

You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money

   You play the most important role in helping your child develop the
   skills they need to manage money. If they see you make money decisions,
   they’re more likely to come to you with their questions.

   Your child will also be influenced by other people in their lives who
   may deal with money in a different way to you, for example,
   grandparents or friends at school. Or they may see adverts or content
   on social media that could influence their attitude to money. This is a
   great opportunity to encourage your child to think about why people
   make different decisions about money.

What is money?

   Mr Orangutan holding up a coin

   Here’s an exercise to help you understand how children see money:
     * Imagine an alien is visiting earth for the first time.
     * What would they think money is for?
     * How would they think it is used?

   As an adult you know exactly what is happening. Children (like the
   alien) don’t understand what money is and how it is used unless it is
   explained to them.
   [214]Back to top

A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   It can be hard to know how to start a conversation about money, so it’s
   worth thinking about what you want to teach your child. This doesn’t
   have to be complicated — you could just decide the basic points you’d
   like to get across and the values or attitudes towards money you think
   are important to share.

   It’s also worth identifying what’s important to your family right now —
   it’s much more interesting for children to get involved in money
   decisions that affect them directly. For example, if you are saving up
   for a holiday you could show them some of things you’re cutting back on
   such as meals out or trips to the cinema.

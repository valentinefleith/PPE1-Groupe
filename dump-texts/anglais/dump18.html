Financial counselling

   Free help to sort out your money problems

   Page reading time: 2 minutes
   (BUTTON) On this page

   Financial counselling is a free and confidential service offered by
   not-for-profit community organisations.

   Financial counsellors do not offer legal advice. If youâ€™re facing legal
   action, get [276]free legal advice straight away.

What financial counsellors do

   Financial counsellors are skilled professionals who provide advice and
   support to people struggling with bills and debt. A financial
   counsellor can:
     * assess your financial situation
     * provide advice about what to do if you're struggling to pay bills
       and fines
     * help you negotiate with government agencies, your landlord,
       utilities, telcos, and other creditors
     * assist you if you're being harassed by [277]debt collectors
     * refer you to other services you might need, such as legal,
       accommodation, health and crisis services

   Read more about [278]what financial counsellors do.

   Never pay for financial counselling. Businesses that charge fees for
   this are [279]debt consolidation and refinancing companies.

   as possible. If you get help early, you will have many more options.

   [32]Leaving Canada Pension Plan could save Albertans billions, says
   study | Reuters
   Although I know this is mostly a political ploy reminiscent of what
   would happen to Canada/the provinces if Quebec pursued sovereignty.
   However the news of the report on how much Alberta should/would receive
   piqued my interest. Perhaps because I had a lot of involvement with
   Lifeworks (formerly Morneau Scheppel) as a H&W benefit trustee. I
   haven't been able to locate the report but it does get me thinking.
   How would this all work?
   Who would be entitled to the new plan?
   How would the payout restructuring work? etc
   I know a lot of this would have to be sorted out by lawyers and
   actuaries. However, if Brexit is possible perhaps deconstructing a
   national pension system is also doable. Has Western alienation taken a
   deep enough hold to make this a possibility. I don't believe so but I
   don't really know how any of it would work. If someone is able to get
   the report I would love to give it a read.
   My apologies if there is already a discussion started in the non money
   topic threads.

   From what was reported, the report is full off errors, miscalculations,
   and self serving assumptions.
   They claim 53% of the CPP fund based on their conclusions.
   The CPP pegs the actual number contributed by Albertans at 16% of the
   fund including the investment gains.
   If Ontario did the same calculation and left the fund before Alberta
   there wouldn't be enough left in the fund to pay Alberta in full or
   anyone else.
   If both Alberta and Ontario left there wouldn't be anything left to pay
   the other Provinces.
   Obviously that isn't going to happen.
   I don't think it is going anywhere because the vast majority of
   Albertans are opposed to it.

   ... your last sentence - all dang, I was hoping that majority would say
   'YES' and support their quack premier. In fact, I would wholeheartedly
   SUPPORT their quack premier's on this - Alberta's pull-out (not
   dismantling) from the national's CPP.
   They can even opt-out immediately and get the EFF out from the rest of
   Canada just as Quebec had wished to. And while they're at that - take
   their EFF quack premier with them. Like the rest of Canada are gonna to
   miss them quacks, including those EFFING FreeDumbers, wasting everyone
   else's money and time.
   And no, their contributions weren't more than half, far less than that
   as they're only 1 province of 10 for Canada with a population that's
   far far less than the eastern ones. Simple math.

   Didn't Alberta's own fund (AIMCo) punch a massive hole in their fund by
   stupidly gambling on volatility derivatives? They lost $4 billion on
   that ridiculous investment.
   Hope they make better choices with their investments if they step away
   from CPP

[82]Alberta loses billions in faulty strategy

   This Bloomberg article tipped me off. Has anyone else heard about this?
   Apparently, AIMCo (the Alberta Investment Management Corp., which
   invests Alberta public pensions) lost billions of $ on faulty
   volatility strategies during the recent market crash...

   Here's the link to the actual report. [92]Alberta pension plan :
   analysis of costs, benefits, risks and considerations - Open Government
   Looks like it was a waste of money, given that its methodology was
   flawed. On the surface it seems to make sense, the asset calculation
   would be contribution with investment returns minus what has been paid
   out. The problem is how they calculate what was paid out. They base it
   only on the people collecting CPP in Alberta, which completely
   overlooks the fact that people would work in Alberta to contribute, but
   then retire outside the province and collect CPP. The problem is that
   they don't include those out-of-province retirees. In fact, they
   actually state that as one of the deficiencies in the study on page 14:
   (iii) Similarly, we believe that the benefit payments attributed to
   Alberta in the publicly available information are based on CPP payments
   made to Alberta residents. Additional refinements may be needed for an
   actual final calculation to reflect the payments to individuals who
   migrated to or from Alberta following retirement or who had a period of
   employment in Alberta.
   And it's pretty obvious that's how they calculated it when you look at
   Annex B: Table B.1.a – Historical Base CPP and Alberta contributions,
   benefits, operating expenses and rates of return ($million except where
   noted).
   All this does is reinforce the fact that people advocating for the APP
   still forget the fact that the CPP belongs to the individual and not
   the province where contributions occurred.

   Thank you for the report and highlighting its key flaws. I am 99%
   certain this initiative won't happen but wanted to explore the concept
   further more from a hypothetical perspective. Not for a moment did I
   believe some of the numbers being put out in our mainstream media. Even
   this link [114]Your pension, your choice | alberta.ca which has some
   interesting information makes some crazy assumptions.
   "Alberta’s government would work with partners at the CPP to develop
   agreements that would allow individuals to move throughout Canada
   without disrupting or decreasing benefits."
   Can Canadians move throughout the country without changing their
   benefits now? Of course they can. 🤦‍♂️
   What I did find interesting in the report was the provisions in place
   for a province to opt out of the plan. And as I imagined implementation
   would be both costly and cumbersome.
   I struggled with the claims that Albertans pay considerably more than
   their share into the plan than they receive and found this report from
   the Fraser institute from 2019.
   [115]Albertans Make Disproportionate Contributions to National
   Programs: The Canada Pension Plan as a Case Study (fraserinstitute.org)
   TLDR - AB has a higher employment rate. Alberta has a higher income
   rate. Therefore AB contributes more per capita than other provinces.
   Another item of interest to me in the Fraser report is the
   interprovincial migration data for those 65 had a slight overlap to the
   years the CPP made a small net payment to retirees. Not sure there is
   any significance in the observation but these peculiarities always
   catch my attention.

   Azure Rectangle Slope Font Line
   I do think the changes made to the CPP have addressed some of the
   concerns put forward in the Fraser report regarding potential
   shortfalls.

   The Premier is between a rock and a hard place. She does not control
   her UCP Party. It and she are controlled by a group by the name of Take
   Back Alberta. They are pulling the strings. Anti science, populist, far
   right, politics and religion combo group. As a result her Party has
   seem many of the old hands, the pros leave the party. Similar in many
   instance to what has happened to the CPC over the past number of years.
   My spouses crazy hillbilly cousins think she is bees knees. That alone
   speaks volumes to me!
   Don't forget.... our Premier is a person who for weeks touted
   hydroxychloroquine as a cure for covid on her open line radio show.
   That is after everyone else walked away from it given the scientific
   evidence to the contrary. She got bounced off the radio station. They
   apparently could not deal with her nonsense any longer.
   If that is not enough, she has so little insight into our justice
   system that for weeks she was suggesting publicly, multiple times, that
   as Premier she would have the ability to 'pardon' people who were
   convicted of covid related and border blocking offences in court and
   found guilty. And she would do so.
   She is an embarrassment to Albertans. The depth of her ignorance in how
   Government works and our justice system in Canada has no limits.

   CPP benefits are determined by level of and duration of contributions.
   If Alberta workers are earn more and work longer they will receive
   higher benefits than those who don't.......regardless of where they
   live and work.
   The benefit is based on the individual contributions, which people can
   view at the Service Canada website.
   As already noted.......the CPP belongs solely and entirely to
   individual workers and no government has any right to claim any part of
   it.
   The CPP also has disability pensions, survivor pensions, and a small
   $2500 death benefit mixed into the calculations.
   The only way to windup the CPP fund equitably would be to freeze all
   contributions from Albertans and pay out the benefits when they are due
   to be paid.
   Alberta could start their own pension fund but would have to do it with
   their own money like the Saskatchewan Pension Plan has already done.

   AIMCO did lose a bunch of cash and they were using pooled pension money
   from the pensions they govern. It is my understanding that LAPP was
   skeptical of the AIMCO investment as it relates to the loss in the
   above discussion and insured the investment and cut the LAPP portion of
   the loss by +/- 20%. I'd have to read to get the true numbers but LAPP
   saved their own *** on that one.

   Exactly right. Using me as an example, I worked and lived in Alberta
   for 20 years but retired elsewhere in Canada. If there was an APP at
   the time with a sharing agreement similar to QPP, then APP would still
   have had an obligation to fund a share of what CPP pays me so that has
   to be accounted for in the formula (like it is for payments to retirees
   outside of Canada). The fact that the discrepancy is so huge is
   interesting. The political line is that Alberta has massively
   over-contributed but it seems that the reality is simply that many
   Canadians have chosen to work in Alberta and then retire elsewhere.

   It is amazing just how ignorant some people are. When Tamara Lich's
   husband went before an Ottawa magistrate during the freedom march he
   tried to claim as a defence that he was only 'protecting' his First
   Amendment rights. He really did not have a clue. The magistrate was
   less than impressed.

   How it would work in practice is that the provincial pension plan would
   pay your benefits wherever you live, just as if you moved to another
   country.

   We have friends who worked in Fort McMurray for 20 years flying back
   and forth to Ontario and then returned permanently when he found a good
   job in Ontario.
   Our son worked in Alberta for a year and paid into CPP, so some of his
   benefit would have to be paid by Alberta.
   They base the calculations on a young work force, but if they divided
   up the CPP fund the same as a commuted value of a pension, wouldn't
   young people get smaller amounts due to the length of time for the
   invested capital to grow until retirement ?

   Shiver me timbers lads.....be it smooth sailing or stormy seas ahead.

   BoC raises interest rates when they want people to spend less, which
   slows down the economy. Then it decreases interest rates when they want
   people to spend more, which stimulates the economy.
   Ok, we get that.
   Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of
   my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't
   spend lots of money. Yet I have a decent income which should allow me
   to spend more and contribute more to the economy.
   Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How
   come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy?
   Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of
   buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing
   to the economy, isn't it?

   Generally if you're not buying products, services, etc that the company
   is selling you are not contributing to their revenue/profits or
   potential expansion. But yes, investments could help a company if they
   can use it to increase their revenue/profits.

   So if the economy is driven by people exchanging services with the help
   of money for transactions (basically, you work to earn money to use
   that money to buy someone else's work), then all of this system of
   stocks (capital) and bonds (debt) are unnecessary tools created for the
   sole purpose of making money from money and manipulating the economy
   using the interest rate of debt.
   Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to
   build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual
   work.
   As opposed to contributing to the economy by working for money as a
   means of transaction to be spent elsewhere. Which is exactly what is
   stimulating the economy.

   Not exactly. Bonds are just debt instruments that companies generally
   use for capital investments which increase productivity or aid in
   producing goods/services. So if that debt is used that way, then it
   does contribute to the economy. It's the same thing for issuing of
   stocks which allows for some capital in exchange for partial ownership
   rather than interest. Then you can say that capital investments the
   companies make are contributing to the economy as they involve
   purchases of goods and services from other companies.
   But, I'd say that trading existing stocks back and forth between
   investors don't really contribute to that cycle, as the money doesn't
   go into the company for any sort of investment. However, one can make
   the argument that those who cash out will end up spending that money
   elsewhere which helps the economy.

   Yes buying stocks, bonds, and even cash deposits all contribute to the
   economy:
   STOCKS - Buying stocks supports the equity markets and allows companies
   to issue new equity. It's a kind of financing. Companies issue equity,
   providing them with cash, and this helps them grow and expand. Equity
   issuance for companies is a very attractive form of financing. While it
   is true that any general stock or ETF transaction you make is probably
   just buying/selling with someone else, the aggregate buying of
   investors over time creates a net buying pressure, and this is what
   allowed any new equity to be issued. For example, [83]Enbridge issued
   $4.6 billion of equity less than a month ago. If nobody was buying the
   TSX, companies could not issue equity (new supply of shares) because
   the prices would just crash downward as supply was added.
   New shares, like those ENB shares, are usually first bought by large
   investment banks. So with this huge $4.6 billion of new shares, you
   have RBC, Morgan Stanley, BMO, CIBC, National Bank, Scotiabank, and TD
   sitting on tons of new shares. This is now in their inventory, and the
   dealers get it out to the market. Indirectly, those new shares of XIC
   might in fact be buying some new ENB shares, via the market makers /
   dealers. Imagine that right after those shares were issued, someone
   came along and bought $10 million in XIC = they buy $338,000 of ENB
   shares. They are likely buying shares from the dealers inventory (RBC,
   BMO, etc). So although it's a complex chain of events, yes
   [84]@MrBlackhill your new share or ETF purchases very much do provide
   financing to companies.
   If you're interested in these processes, I suggest watching some
   Bloomberg Television (and week-end summary shows like Wall Street
   Week). You will see coverage of new equity and bond financing that's
   happening, like big issuances of shares, how those shares were
   received, etc.
   BONDS - When you buy bonds, you are lending money to a variety of
   borrowers. For example an aggregate bond fund will hold a variety of
   debts, including corporate debt and securitized debts. So buying bonds
   will both lend money to corporations (allowing them to function) and
   even buys pools of securitized consumer debts, all kinds of things like
   credit card debts, auto loans, etc.
   BANK DEPOSITS - Even cash / savings deposits help by providing a
   deposit base to the banks. Loans are given out against this deposit
   base. The more in deposits they have, especially locked-in deposits
   like GICs, the more the banks can lend out. Banks obtain their funding
   from many sources, including bonds and deposits.
   I think people forget how much companies (and banks) depend on
   investors and deposits. It's a kind of complacency, when stock and bond
   markets are strong. We've been in very strong markets for the last few
   years, and there has been plentiful availability of equity and bond
   financing. But very "interesting" things happen when investors stop
   buying these assets. Without new bond buyers, companies have a lot of
   trouble issuing debt, and their financing costs rise. Without eager
   equity investors, and NET buying pressure on stocks, companies cannot
   issue equity and must turn to more expensive types of financing, such
   as bonds or bank borrowing.

   That's because of your perspective on the economy.
   I think you have an incorrect perspective on the economy and how it
   works, so I think your frugal lifestyle is just fine and an excellent
   contribution.
   In fact I think a responsible and frugal lifestyle, with significant
   personal savings is GREAT for the economy as it makes you more
   resilient and efficient, and better able to handle the various economic
   gyrations, which again is good.
   Look at all the overspending indebted people, do you think their chaos
   is good for the economy?

   Again we have different perspectives.
   I think investing and helping people do work IS a contribution
   A lawn cutting business does better with a powered mower than a push
   mower, and better with a commercial riding mower than a residential
   push mower.
   In short we have wildly different views on the economy and our economic
   system, which is evident from many discussions.
   And also largely explains our different political views as they pertain
   to economics..

   Because those people are really easy to control, and they like control.
   Oh want to increase spending, drop rates and they get another $50k in
   credit.
   Want to cut spending, hike rates, and their debt will cut their
   cashflows by $500/month.
   Basically gives them a dial to control a large chunk of the economy.
   But it also makes things unstable, painful for those people, and
   occasionally they'll go nuts and just drop rates to zero so they can
   enjoy a "good" economy.
   It's not actually good or healthy for the economy, but it gives those
   in power... POWER. and they like that.

   Thanks for this explanation, it actually fits my understanding, though
   I'm playing Devil's advocate because I'm trying to understand the
   difference between helping the economy by spending vs helping the
   economy by... saving?
   Because I don't get why when we say "we need to stimulate the economy",
   we always mean "we need people to spend more", it never means "we need
   people to save more".
   I'm not sure this will make any sense, but I'll try to add some of my
   thoughts from my limited understanding. On this Monday morning...
   Where I'm trying to understand the difference between these two
   different kinds of contribution to the economy:
    1. The current meaning where we play with interest rates so that
       people take on more debt for the end goal of spending more,
       stimulating the economy
    2. vs The understanding that investing sold be helping the economy
       because it needs lenders (bond buyers) and capital (stock buyers),
       yet we say that when people save more money and spend less, it's...
       bad for the economy

   And that's why I end up concluding that the real source of contribution
   to the economy is #1, transactional, because #2 is only about the
   current tools of our current economic system (capital and debt, a 100%
   human-made system so we could decide to change its rules), tools that
   we don't really need (the tool of capital is only about 400 years old
   so we surely could live without it, though the tool of debt is about
   5,000 years old so for that one it's certainly harder to envision an
   economic system without that tool).
   Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system
   cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so
   if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the
   remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the
   pace of economic growth would slow down, unless we decide to redirect
   that money from a consumption economy to a social economy where extra
   money is spent/invested into education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.
   Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of
   the tools (capital & debt), because we need an equilibrium between the
   lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money
   saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system
   because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough
   borrowers (those who spend).
   Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always
   good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money
   is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount
   of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly
   come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

   Nope, capital is an abstract term meaning "resources", and it's a real
   physical thing. You're just looking at the abstractions instead of the
   real items.
   You could do away with the abstractions of currency and "capital" and
   debt, but it's the same thing.
   Currency is really a "debt" of a type I'm working in advance, and paid
   a currency, which represents a debt that the person giving it now owes
   me. which I can trade for items, or future work.
   Debt has existed in some form for a long time, "I'll scratch your back,
   and you scratch mine" is a form of "debt" or social contract.

   Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system
   cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so
   if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the
   remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the
   pace of economic growth would slow down, unless we decide to redirect
   that money from a consumption economy to a social economy where extra
   money is spent/invested into education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.
   Click to expand...

   But you'd be spending on the essential needs, I think we could spend
   almost all our money on "education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.". Interestingly you forgot about defense.
   I don't believe in "no spending", it just doesn't make sense.
   I also think getting lost in the abstractions can be problematic.
   They are incredibly useful abstractions, and we've build massive
   systems on them, but occasionally it's important to consider them from
   first principles.

   When the government gives a lot of people money there is always a
   noticeable bump to the GDP and economy.
   If people invest or save the money there is no bump to the economy and
   it is referred to by central bankers as "dead money".
   If everyone was frugal to the extreme there would be fewer companies
   and employees and the economy would shrink and enter a recession.
   Our economy is a "consumer spending" economy depending on a balance of
   incomes and prices, which is why rising income and wealth disparity is
   dangerous to the economy.
   Businesses depend on mass consumer spending and expand production and
   services (jobs) when consumer demand warrants it.
   I have yet to hear a company say they are expanding production because
   rich people have more money invested in stock markets.

   When the government gives people money, it causes an temporary bump,
   which gets paid back later when they pay off the debt.
   or they make it systemic, and it pushes up inflation.
   The thing is that money should represent work, or value, and if they
   just put out more, it's call inflation, but really what they mean is
   they're discounting the value of the work you did.
   Your 1.5hrs of min wage work for $10hr a decade ago is only worth 1
   hour of $15/hr min wage work today.
   The "stimulus" is just shuffling around deck chairs.
   Real economic growth is creation of value, and doing things.
   It could be dumb things or good things, but that's a different issue.
   I don't think people have trouble with consumers buying stuff, it's
   just the silly wastefulness.
   I don't see anything wrong with saving, or hiring a personal trainer,
   or paying for an extra dental cleaning.
   I do think it's wasteful to fill a swimming pool with orbeez, and I'm
   glad that trend died out. So I don't do that.

   It's been a long time since I took economics, but essentially it's the
   mulitiplier effect (I cannot remember the exact term). Types of
   spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a
   multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a
   number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers,
   etc) within that system. Government spending also has another
   multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and
   Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the
   economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for
   someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the
   buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving
   is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item
   with but the multiplier is now lower.
   Sorry if that isn't very clear, Its' been almost 30 years since I took
   this, I wonder if the theory has changed. Probably.

   If it's bad, then why do policymakers and economists (mostly) all
   encourage huge debt levels?

   Because the negative effect on the debt at a macro level still produces
   a larger increase in the economy at a macro economics level. The
   problem is the microeconomics of it, debt on an individual level is bad
   in general which is the reverse. If we are looking at the balance, the
   policymakers should be incentivizing those that can spend more with out
   debt to do so.

   On a 'smart' device, please excuse autocorrect/when letters are
   missing.

   Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How
   come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy?
   Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of
   buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing
   to the economy, isn't it?
   Click to expand...

   Yes it is. It's just not done directly by you and it is outside your
   control.
   GDP measures everything a country produces.
   GDP=C+I+(X-M)+G
   where C=consumption and I=investment
   [the other terms are exports, imports and government spending]
   Your consumption to meet your current needs is clearly part of C and if
   you reduce your actual spend year over year you would contribute to a
   decline in demand transmitted through C.
   "I" on the other hand is expenditures that are capital goods. Eg
   business buying new machines, new buildings etc. When you put it in the
   Bank you are leaving it up to the Bank to lend it to the eventual user
   that will make the capital investment.
   Added: to be clear. "I" does not include financial assets. It is
   physical investments by business. When you purchase financial assets
   you are facilitating the ability of business to grow the economy.

   GDP is defined by the following formula: GDP = Consumption + Investment
   + Government Spending + Net Exports
   Even if you spend $0 and just buy investments, you are still
   contributing to GDP. Your purchase of investments boosts the assett
   price and encourage other people to spend more because of wealth
   effect.
   Don't feel bad about being frugal. Stable spending habit is more
   valuable than boom and bust. Of course, the risk is asset bubble.
   I have no problem with central banks manipulating consumer habits. The
   problem I have with central bank is they manipulate the financial
   market by fooling people to buy high with 0% interest rate and now
   trying to fool people into selling low by hiking interest rate to the
   highest in 7 years. The fact that they waited in 2021 for a freaking 1
   year before hiking interest rate at the point inflation reached a
   whopping 8% and now they are not happy with 3% inflation? and keep
   hiking?
   Mortgage payment increase far exeeds the inflation damage to my cash
   flow. My total expense remained the same or even dropped because I cut
   it substantially vs 2021 but mortgage payment will increase few
   hundreds $ / month soon if they don't cut it. They are playing a very
   dangerous game: global population is peaking and birth rate is dropping
   across the globe. With fewer population, they can't have high interest
   rate for long, look at Japan. I no longer act on investing decision
   based on Fed actions. No longer be a sheep to the Fed. I buy and hold
   best investment forever like the best investors do. Not jumping in and
   out of different investment vehicles because of different interest
   rate. Don't fall into the trap of buy high and sell low! Long term bond
   crashed ? Don't sell low! They will come back up.

   Yet ultimately, "stimulating" the economy is about spending more, not
   saving more. Because spending has a much greater effect than saving.
   Imagine the situation where most people were saving money and barely
   spending vs if most people were spending money and barely saving.

   Yeah GDP is a funny metric... It measures everything, except what
   matters.
   Simon Kuznets, who won a Nobel prize for developing the GDP metric,
   repeatedly warned that the GDP only measured market activity and should
   not be mistaken for a metric of social or even economic well-being.
   If I mow my lawn and you mow your lawn, GDP says nothing. If I mow your
   lawn for $100 and you mow my lawn for $100, GDP goes up.
   If I have time to take care of my parents and my kids, GDP says
   nothing. If my kids are at the daycare and my parents are in a senior
   home, GDP goes up.
   If I cut down a forest and sell the timber, GDP goes up. If I strip a
   mountain range to mine coal, GDP goes up. If we extend the working day
   and push back retirement age, GDP goes up.
   But, aside from the GDP debate, even though my investments (I) are part
   of the GDP, what we prefer is my consumption (C). I've always heard the
   need to stimulate the economy as a need to increase spending by
   consumers, therefore consumption (C), and I've never heard about the
   need to increase savings by individuals, therefore investments (I) as a
   means to stimulate the economy. It shows when we see BoC decreasing
   rates to increase spending to simulate the economy vs BoC increasing
   rates to decrease spending to slow down the economy.
   Actually, what are we implying when we say "stimulate the economy" or
   "slow down the economy"? It's about the economic activity? What is the
   measure of economic activity? GDP? Actually, we're "fighting"
   inflation, isn't, that's what we mean? So "economic activity" is
   translated as "inflation"?
   Maybe it has to do with that multiplier that [211]@Plugging Along is
   talking about. That's why the focus is always on spending, because it
   has the greatest impact.

   Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting
   money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate
   bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to
   put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank
   where it doesn't circulate in the economy. Rather than looking at the
   safety of the banks or GICs, people would be encouraged to find other
   sources of return. Unfortunately, in Canada, we've been encouraged with
   the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now
   we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception
   exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of
   looking into investing in companies.

   Yes I think so too. And all that money into real estate is very
   unproductive. It's a terrible misallocation of capital IMO.
   I suspect that we will be paying the consequences for several decades.

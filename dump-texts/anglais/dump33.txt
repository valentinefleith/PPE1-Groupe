Money Advice Scotland featured in BBC Disclosure: The Debt Dealers

   BBC Scotland’s programme Disclosure – The Debt Dealers features Money
   Advice Scotland’s Training Development Lead, Ged Mulvey, who spoke to
   reporter Sam Poling about the impact of being in the wrong debt
   solution. The programme focuses on the trust deed market in Scotland,
   and in particular how some providers advertise and sign up clients.

   Ged Mulvey said: “For the right person, a trust deed can absolutely be
   the right solution and there are some great trust deed providers out
   there.

   “However, our concern is that someone who would have been better suited
   to another debt solution can end up in a trust deed. Because clients
   will pay fees to their trust deed provider and these are typically paid
   more at the start, if the trust deed fails due to a client being unable
   to maintain payments (indicating it was not the most appropriate
   solution in the first place), they can find themselves back in their
   original position with their debt outstanding but having paid
   significant fees to their trust deed provider – as we see with
   Cassandra who is featured in the programme. She should have never been
   in a trust deed based on her circumstances.”

   The programme also discusses the FCA’s upcoming intervention in this
   market with its ban on debt packagers (third parties who receive a
   referral fee from passing a client to a trust deed provider). However,
   this does not completely mitigate the risk of clients going into a
   trust deed when it is not the best option for them; as we see in the
   programme, many trust deed providers use social media and digital
   advertising to target people and encourage them to get in touch, with
   no third party referrer needed.

   The programme highlights the importance of the free money advice sector
   in Scotland, where organisations like Christians Against Poverty and
   StepChange (both featured) and others such as Citizens Advice Bureaux,
   local authorities, and other free-to-client money advice agencies can
   assess each client’s individual circumstances to determine which option
   will be best for them in helping them with their debt.

   website.

   Disclosure – The Debt Dealers airs on BBC 1 Scotland at 8pm Monday
   19^th June and BBC Iplayer.

   Capital gains tax is levied on profits from assets ranging from shares
   to second homes, buy-to-let properties and personal possessions.

   It is traditionally applied at lower rates than income tax because the
   assets in question tend to be those on which people are taking a risk -
   whether an entrepreneurial one, or via investments held outside Isas
   and pensions.

   Employment income and savings interest are more guaranteed, and so
   taxed differently and more heavily.

   Your main home that you live in, known as your Principal Private
   Residence, is exempt from CGT. That, plus an annual tax-free allowance
   that until last April was £12,300, has meant CGT is typically levied on
   wealthier taxpayers.

   However, radical cuts to the CGT allowance by the Government make it
   inevitable that many more people will have to pay it in future.

       podcast

Capital gains tax is levied on your profits

   Capital gains tax is paid on the profits when you sell an asset - what
   it sells for, less what you paid for it or it was worth when acquired.

   Depending on the asset there are reliefs available and each person has
   a capital gains tax allowance, which is currently £6,000, to offset
   against their gains.

Got a tax question?

   Heather Rogers, founder and owner of Aston Accountancy, is This is
   Money's tax columnist.

   She can answer your questions on any tax topic - tax codes, inheritance
   tax, income tax, capital gains tax, and much more.

   You can write to Heather at taxquestions@thisismoney.co.uk.

   But the CGT tax-free allowance will be slashed again to £3,000 in April
   2024.

   'If an asset was transferred to you as a gift, then the value at
   transfer will be the valuation for acquisition,' says This is Money's
   tax expert Heather Rogers.

   'When the asset is left to you through a will, then the probate value
   will be the value you are deemed to have acquired it for.'

   Rogers adds: 'You can deduct costs of acquisition and disposal if
   relevant - the estate agent's and solicitor's fees on sale, for
   example. You can also deduct costs where you have spent money and have
   added value to the asset.'

   Regarding CGT rates, if you're a higher or additional rate taxpayer (40
   per cent or 45 per cent respectively) the CGT rate is 28 per cent on
   gains from residential property and 20 per cent on gains from other
   chargeable assets.

   For basic rate taxpayers (20 per cent), if your taxable gain plus your
   total taxable income fall within the basic income tax band of £12,571
   to £50,270, the CGT rate is 18 per cent on residential property and 10
   per cent on other gains.

   If the amount is higher, the CGT rate is 28 per cent on residential
   property and 20 per cent on other gains.

   The Government has more information on CGT rates here.

   Rogers explains how to carry forward capital losses to offset them
   against capital gains here.

   And she looks at which types of personal possessions, referred to in
   this context as 'chattels', are liable for CGT and which are exempt
   here.

What do buy-to-let landlords need to know about CGT?

   When you come to sell your buy-to-let property, there will be capital
   gains tax to pay on any profit.

   It applies to any property which is not your main home - your Principal
   Private Residence - including private second homes as well.

   CGT is levied at the rates explained above, but as gains are added to
   income to deliver a total amount this means that in practice most
   landlords making decent profits should pay the 28 per cent rate.

   There are two reliefs you can get on your CGT bill, but they are both
   less generous than they once were.

   First, there is a capital gains tax regime specifically for
   'accidental' landlords, who once lived in a property before going on to
   let it out.

   If a landlord rents out a property that was once their main home,
   capital gains tax only applies on the amount the home went up in value
   while they weren't living there.

   Landlords can also add an extra nine months onto the amount of time
   they lived at the property - this is known as the 'final period
   exemption'.

   As an example of how this works,  a landlord who has owned their
   property for 10 years and lived in it for two would be taxed on seven
   years and three months of capital gains – the 10 years, minus the two
   years residency plus the reduced nine months' relief.

Ten tips for buy-to-let landlords

    Read This is Money's guide to the essentials of property investment
   here.

   Another key CGT allowance to be aware of is 'lettings relief'.

   When a landlord sells their former home after renting it out, up to
   £40,000 of their gain can be exempted from capital gains tax - but this
   now applies only if they lived in the property with their tenants.

   Meanwhile, you can reduce your CGT bill by deducting some of the
   expenses associated with buying and managing a property.

   You may also be able to offset losses on other property against your
   capital gains tax bill.

   My English is not good, so I can't write unique seo optimization
   articles for the adsense site. And i havn`t money for buy articles. So
   how I can earn some money for example 50-100$ in a month?
   I have some technics skills in wordpress, seo (in my native language),
   but English is poor, so I don't feel better to go on Odesk as a
   freelancer, where is a high competition.
   So I think about to create sites which have non unique content and to
   promote it in social networks. But i dont know is this good idea.
   So what I can to do for making money in such condition? Sorry for my
   stupid question.

       Create sites for people that speak your native language. Not all
       websites have to be in English in order to make money. If you can
       write fluently in your native language, then you can earn money.
       Sure the traffic may not be as much as English sites but you should
       be able to make a little side income with a site in a different
       language.
       Also, you can teach others how to speak your home language on
       Fiverr or by starting your own membership course. Teach others how
       to speak fluently in your language and you could be making some
       decent money.

            Nobody interesting in Ukranian or especially Russian, today.
            Besides, I think where are a lot people who doing like this.
            So competition is high.

                      No - he didn't mean (or say) that at all.
                      Presumably, as a Ukrainian speaker, yourself, you
                      also have fluent or almost-fluent Russian, too? I
                      appreciate that they're two languages, not one, but
                      very similar, I think? That's an enormous online
                      market for affiliate marketing (and various other
                      things as well). Have you thought about doing
                      something in Russian rather than in English?
                      .

                           i am russian speaker and also speak ukranian
                           very well. Online market in such languages is
                           very poor, so PPC is low, so maybe is better
                           and easy to get some $ from english market + it
                           is an opportunity to learn English well. You
                           don`t know that in a few months this Russia or
                           Ukraine will be like Africa or worse. Because
                           there are stupid, foolish government!
                           I have some adsense sites on russian but PPC is
                           very low. So i just want to know which better
                           direction for me:
                           1) autobloging - creating sites with non unique
                           articles
                           2) social networking
                           3) freelance but i don`t know how
                              - Thanks

                 Maybe you could try to write some articles in English and
                 then pay someone to proof read them (correct them) You
                 can find people on fiverr who will proof read your
                 articles for a lot less than if you ask someone to write
                 the whole article.
                 Good luck - It's terrible what's happening in Ukraine at
                 the moment.

                      It has spent a lot of time to write articles + time
                      to rank in google for long tail keywords. So to earn
                      50-100$ in a month from adsense it will take 6

       Have a look on fiverr.com and see what services are there that you
       could also offer - I'm thinking things like graphics, coding, or
       even something like quirky like "I'll sing Happy Birthday to You in
       Russian or Ukrainian for $5". or "I'll do a graphic of your name in
       Cyrillic script for $5" I know $4 (which is what you'll get after
       fiverr take their cut) isn't much, but you'd only need to do 3 or 4
       a week to make $50 a month.
       Good luck, and stay safe!

       I guess this what makes internet marketing "discriminational" - it
       must be terribly hard for you to get global attention and earn some
       $$ unless you focus on your region. Try to find some niche in
       Russian/Slavic speaking world (you mentioned you are from Ukraine)
       ? Or get somebody at fiverr or cheap outsourcing website for
       content?

       What have you been doing until now? Did you try to make some money
       online or is this your first time you want to try this out?
       If you have wordpress skills, and you can at least understand some
       English, then why not try Odesk or other websites? There are so
       many non-English speakers on these websites, offering their
       services, even in other languages.
       Also, I suggest you start learning English now! It will take you a
       while, but you are already conversing with us on this forum, in
       English! So, it's not like you're starting from nothing

                 People are trying to helpful but truth is - you can't
                 work effectively selling to market of people if you can't
                 speak their language reasonably well.
                 If you have sufficient technical skills you might try
                 Fiverr or freelance sites but you seem reluctant to do
                 that. I think perhaps your technical skills are not that
                 high but that's a guess from what you've posted. If you
                 have a service that is well priced and well done -
                 competition isn't such a big issue.
                 No matter what you try, it may not work. Someone has to
                 say it. Working online is not magic. You must be prepared
                 for the market you choose to work in - and a grasp of the
                 language is basic.

                      Find the money to pay for ads instead of focusing
                      your attention on article marketing. That way, you
                      will get results faster with paid ads.

                      There are people in countries where English is not

       So what if I`ll create a site with stolen content from other sites?
       Put a nice looking theme, change title and images. And promote this
       site in fb, twitter, forgetting about google. If I can get traffic
       from social networks so can monetize with some PPC. So it doesn`t
       require a good knowing english.

   There are people in countries where English is not their first language
   and they still manage to do really well online targeting the English
   speaking market.
            I'm well aware of that - I've done a lot of writing for
            several of them. I wasn't being rude - just being honest.
            Someone posting "I think your English is good enough" doesn't
            make it true.
            The most useful post in this thread is from Michael Fuentes.
            Did the OP follow up on that?
            What no one has mentioned is the potential for using his own
            native language to target the Ukrainian and Russian people in
            other parts of the world. I don't know the size of that market
            but I see Vietnamese people reading Vietnamese language papers
            printed in the US. Why not a blog in his own language?
            Wouldn't ex-pats from russia and Ukraine be interested in
            what's going on there - especially now?

                 Today, many Russian webmasters run to the English IM.
                 Because russian economics began collapsing. Ukranian
                 worse. In Ukraine stupid government (which 99.9% are rich
                 bad guys) wants that poor people go to war. So I do not
                 want to fight with the Russian. I want to leave the
                 country. I want to get some passive income which helps me
                 to settle in another country in the beginning.

                      Judging from your answers to suggestions, your
                      English comprehension isn't that good, either.
                      But then we get this:

                      Right - you can steal what you want - and fake
                      it...and since that appears to be the plan, I'm done
                      here.

                 That must be golden advise. There are HUGE Russian
                 speaking minorities all over the world. 1 million in
                 Germany alone, even more in Israel, 1.6 m in the US.
                 Besides, Moscow used to be the most expensive city in the
                 world. It has neighborhoods where house prices start at
                 $20 million... Just find the right stuff to sell to these
                 people.

       Don't focus on adsense. It's really hard to earn something on

       services are much appreciated. Use the money to grow your own

       Actually to earn as your target $50 to $100 it is not a big amount.
       Anyone can earn this amount easily form the online sector. If you
       know the Wordpress & SEO, it is a good chance to earn the money.
       You will be able to earn by using the Wordpress & SEO. beside
       these, you should learn ENGLISH. because it is international

                 I am also on the same boat. I am non-native English
                 speaking person.
                 What I find out that creating video is the only way I
                 find that helpful to you to earn some money, considering
                 that English is second language for you. Nobody is going
                 to pay you unless you are providing some value in return.
                 You can use your technical expert in SEO, Wordpress or
                 making video skills which require less English. Look for
                 the skills where English is not a problem for you. Than
                 go for learning about it. I know that you are desperate
                 and does not have much time to learn and looking for fast
                 money. But remember that your skills are only thing which
                 can earn you money not the freating about problem. So
                 focus on building skills and work as much as possible to
                 learn more and more and than move yourself to fiverr.
                 There you can learn about trade or polish your skills.

       I think the easiest way is to leverage other peoples systems, ie
       sales funnels, so that they can do all the telling and selling for
       you. All you should do is create a simple squeeze page, even using
       free squeeze page creators online and then send them to the
       affiliate link of the product you're promoting. Some affiliate
       programs also provide email swipes, which means you can simply copy
       and paste, no need to write emails.

       There's loads of places to find affiliate products with high
       converting sales funnels, one of the common place is clickbank.com,
       others include JVZoo. You simply signup with them Free and browse
       the marketplace to see the offers. Let me give you an example of a
       completely FREE way to get started, if you're on a budget:
       1)lets say you're into "Make Money Online" niche, you goto
       clickbank.com, signup for free. Then goto a site like cbsnooper.com
       where you can see hot clickbank products. Find one in the top 10
       that is a biz opp program. Then go to click bank and search for it.
       Once you find, click "promote" button and your affiliate link will
       be created.
       2) next you go mailchimp.com, signup for autoresponder. its free
       for first 1000 subscribers I think - You need this to build your
       list so that you can collect subscribers, build relationship, help
       your subscribers with tips and also send promotional offers.
       3) Next you can go to a place like squeezepagecreator.com and
       create your free squeeze page thats going to be the front end page
       to your affiliate offer, so once a visitor subscribe to your
       squeeze page, it redirects to your affilate link page of the offer
       you're promoting. .
       You will need to learn how to add your mailchimp code into your
       squeeze page.
       4) Traffic - There probably thousands of ways to get free and paid
       traffic, you can start off with free traffic classified ads like
       backpage.com craigslist, create youtube videos even in your
       language, you can target your community of people as well like
       this.
       The above is a simple business model which many have used to make
       money online with a simple ONE page website, ie your squeeze page.
       If you want, send me a private message I can send you my free
       report on some cool free traffic methods.

       Honest answer - get a skill that is visual - graphic arts, web
       design, creating videos (not voice over).
       You can sell graphics, webdesign to us people - they will overlook
       your grammar skills.
       However, it is unrealistic to think that you will be able to write
       articles, content etc that would be acceptable to anyone whose
       first language is English.
       Make a very visual website. Respond quickly and simply....the more
       non Engish speakers add "flowery" stuff to their replies the worse
       it looks. (example : My dearest Madam, most excellent, blah blah

       Can you write a blog with in your native language? If yes, target
       locally.
       Example:
       Write blogs about love advice in your own language, drive traffic
       into it (it's more easier to get traffic and to rank).
       Don't sell yet, gain exposure and trust first before selling. After
       you gained the two, you can now sell.
       What I'm gonna sell? Good question.
       You can create a store in your blogs like T-shirt, mugs, or an
       Ebooks etc... (based on your chosen niche).
       You can even call some local businesses to promote their business
       via your blogs(banners, adspace) via monthly subcription.
       Always remember these:
       * Your weakness can be an opportunity.
       * Language is not a barrier if you have the DESIRE.
       * Brainstorm, think of an idea and take action.
       * Why fish in the ocean, if you can fish on a lake.

       Guys forget about the Russian traffic. It is not commercial. Not
       many will buy some stuff like it will be in English world. And
       russian is just 5% of world internet traffic then english is 55% of
       whole world. And eCommerce in US ES more developed like it is in
       Russia.

       Believe me, what you really need, is a new mindset. There are
       opportunities everywhere, you just do not see them. Your mind sees
       only obstacles and rejects opportunities. It's all in your
       subconscious mind.
       Your English could be fluent, you could live in NYC, and you would
       still struggle.
       The good news is, this can all be changed. There are hundreds of
       different methods, programs and books available, but for now I'd
       recommend you'd buy yourself just one, and stick to it. Commit
       yourself fully to the path of change, be engaged with it at least 2
       hours each day for a month - no matter what. The book is I Can Make
       You Rich by Paul McKenna. I checked, this book is translated into
       Russian, so buy that translation. Of course, you could read the
       English version too, but Russian is far better for you - all the
       more that this book comes with a hypnosis CD that you better use
       too. The Russian title of the book is this: Я сделаю вас богатыми.

            I doubt about what. NYC is a big city and a big opportunity
            and a lot jobs at an offline. If my English would be the best
            I could write a lot articles at least. So 100$ in month will

                 $100, even $300 a month in NYC means living on the

       What you need is a new brain and a whole new personality.
       You've been given solid advice and all you did was brush them off
       as something that is not doable because it requires a bit of using
       the english language. Why ask in the first place?
       Seriously, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

       Here's another idea: have you thought about starting a website, in
       your native language even, and write about what's going on in your
       country right now? Like a news website, if you will.
       Also, the advice someone here gave you, about developing visual
       skills, is good! All in all, you have to start learning how to DO
       something, so have you managed to do anything up until now?

            I like Slade's idea! I can read your English just fine. If you
            had a Blog writing about your Country and what it's going
            through while being at War - I think it could be hugely
            popular and get a lot of visitors.
            Once you started getting visitors - you could come right out
            and ask your visitors if they would "invest" in you and your
            site. Of course you could also market in the normal ways on
            the site.
            Right now Denis - I don't think it's your lack of fluency in
            English that's holding you back. I think you just have to
            think outside the box, so to speak.

       I am Vietnamese. English is not my first language. Vietnam is still
       a poor country. No need to talk about the government here because
       you can know by reading the news (Vietnam - China sea conflict,
       never ending, who knows when there will be a war). And as you can
       see, my English is not perfect. I don't have IT skills like you. I
       was not born in a rich family. Currency inflation here is very high
       (1usd = 21.000 vnd). Polluted environment. Expensive goods and
       services but low salary. Rich Vietnamese people who buy expensive
       cars often are those who take advantage of corrupted economy and
       earn a lot from stocks/gold/petrol and real estates. There are no
       chance for common people like me to be that rich. There was a
       newspaper said that if a common person works a normal 9-5 job then
       it will take him 150 years to buy a house in the central to live.
       But..
       There are still some Vietnamese people earn by using their true
       skills and their willing to learn and adapt
       And..
       I am earning from Internet myself, with my unique skill of
       Moondancing, starting from Fiverr. Then I learn knowledge of
       internet marketing. I am more confident now with some of my
       projects that earning not much but I feel happy because I have
       freedom to do what I like
       So what are you gonna say?
       I agree that ALL YOU NEED IS A NEW MINDSET!!!
       If your English is not good, then STUDY MORE!!!
       I can see you have received many helpful advices. Why not at least
       try to TAKE ACTION to do it?
       My aoplogy for my hard words. I wish you best luck to have your own

       Well to be honest you can make $50 - $100 per day by simply doing
       this -
       1 join FB Groups
       2 post affiliate links in the posts on daily basis.
       3 this would hardly need and language expertise.
       4 moreover use social media services rather than article or content
       writing services on sites like odesk, elance or even FIVERR.

       Resell some stuff online using the benefits of your location -
       eBay, iOffer, eBid, etc. No, I am not joking - the benefits of your
       location. There are active communities online that like and collect
       former USSR stuff - cameras, lenses, watches...
       I saw some vendors on eBay from Ukraine selling camera lenses for
       $200-$400. You could probably get them for less than $50. Film
       photography has its own niche right now and is not dead.
       That way you would be able to collect some money for relocation or
       other needs. In the same time get some freelance skills, make
       website and start sell your service online charging western rates
       (because you won´t be desperate for money). With your own site and
       laptop you have a virtual company - you just need clients and you
       can work from anywhere in the world.
       Or create some digital product and sell it online (for instance -
       an eBook which will solve some problem - you can pay $50 some on
       oDesk to write it for you, price it at $19.99) - and then sell,
       sell, sell...You have all the advice on the WF. Just SEARCH.
       Of course, in the meantime, improve your English but not for
       writing articles - for communicating with your clients.
       Play on your strengths (location, skills, some other advantage...),
       not your weaknesses (writing on bad English).

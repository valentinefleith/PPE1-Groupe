'Finances Coaching' as a job-hobby?

   « on: January 20, 2023, 06:06:40 AM »
   I'm pretty good at finding deals, collecting information, and
   optimising or at least improving.
   I think it would be possibly interesting and fulfilling to help other
   people sort out their finances.
   I like being paid for my time, but this would be a pocket money type
   idea. But I'm wondering if it's more trouble than it's worth - would I
   need some level of financial accreditation? How would it work cross
   border (I live in France, I would want to deal with mostly British or
   Canadian people I suppose as I have reasonable knowledge of those
   systems, and can research easily enough; I wouldn't mind English
   speakers in France by my French is not good enough at this point to try
   and do this in French... though that could be a goal of its own).
   I know that I cannot offer "financial advice", ie a specific product,
   without certification. I suppose the coaching would be more general - I
   see these things on your budget, can you replace with x, y, or z; you
   should open and use this kind of account; and so on.
   I'm wondering - is this worth the hassle? More trouble than it's worth?
   I guess the liability thing kicks in when money is exchanged, and
   that's mostly what I'm concerned about (this is not the USA; I'm
   unlikely to be sued, but still, I don't want to take the risk for 50
   Euros for a couple of hours or more of work!!).

   IÂm actually in the process of making a career change into financial
   planning, but am seriously considering starting a financial coaching
   business to start out and gain some hands-on, client-facing practical
   experience helping people as well as generating some money.  When I was
   an NCO in the Air Force, I did this for several of our new Airmen who
   came in; kids who often were still teenagers, just got married to their
   high-school sweetheart and had no clue why renterÂs insurance was
   important or why it was important to have an emergency fund, etc.  I
   loved it and found it very personally fulfilling, hence the carer
   change.  IÂm sure youÂll find it very rewarding, too.
   Financial coaching is different than financial planning in several
   regards.  IÂm in the U.S. so that is the only perspective I can give,
   but much should apply to your situation.  ItÂs kind of the wild, wild
   west in that there are currently no regulations for financial
   coaching.  ThereÂs certain things you canÂt legally do such as give
   investing advice, i.e. you can educate them on Âthis is what the
   RÃ©gime gÃ©nÃ©ral des salariÃ©s isÂ and Âthis is what index funds are
   and why they tend to make a good investment vehicleÂ but you cannot
   recommend anything specific such as Âopen a plan Ã©pargne action and
   invest the money into Vanguard VTSAXÂ for example.  In the United
   States you have to be licensed to give investment advice but as long as
   you are not doing that or selling financial products, youÂre good,
   France, most likely the same.   Financial coaching isnÂt so much about
   telling them what to do, but educating them and guiding their
   decisions-you donÂt make recommendations but help them see their
   options and help them decide which are the best options for them.
   Also, because they are making the decisions, not you, you are not
   liable for the decisions they make.  I know in the U.S. at least, if
   you wanted to you could get whatÂs called E&O insurance (errors and
   omissions) which can cover you for liability and is relatively
   inexpensive.  France may have something similar, I donÂt know for
   sure.  As for accreditations, there are none that are currently
   required in Canada or the U.S., though one that is quickly gaining
   steam is the ÂAccredited Financial CounselorÂ or AFC offered by the
   Association For Financial Counseling & Planning (AFCPE).  You may have
   something applicable where you are.
   As for income, you get to set your rates.  In the U.S. itÂs not
   entirely uncommon for financial coaches to make the equivalent of about
   36-46,000 Euros before taxes their first couple of years and around
   90,000 Euros a year before taxes after 4-5 years doing it if youÂre
   dedicated and build your client base.  I know the U.S. perspective
   isnÂt necessarily what youÂre looking for, but I hope IÂve been of some
   help to you.  Good luck!

   Thanks for the reply! It's probably not for me, too many hurdles for a
   hobby - I'll just keep on trying to get the people I come into contact
   with to think about things differently.

   I believe a few people here do this. There is also always blogging and
   I don't know if it is still profitable, but some people have made money
   on those short ebooks on Amazon. If the market is not too saturated and
   you have a niche, perhaps you could a series of financial ebooks.

   I think the main problem is that the kind of people who could use this
   advice aren't willing to pay for it.
   A 22-year-old starting their first job isn't going to pay $500 to have
   someone teach them why it's important to save for retirement and not go
   spend their paycheck on a new car, etc.
   Most financial planners make their money by managing assets and taking
   a percentage fee. Find a few hundred people that have collective assets
   of millions of dollars and extract a small percentage of that asset
   base every year. Or as a fee-only advisor you're charging a few
   thousand dollars to provide one-time services that would include that
   kind of investment advice that is regulated.
   As a company commander in the National Guard, I had 130 Soldiers - most
   of whom were around 18-25 and did not have a lot of financial literacy.
   I tried to address that and had certified financial planners come and
   give classes but most of it didn't stick. We were deploying and many of
   them would be making a lot more money and have lots of tax advantages
   like a savings account that paid 10% interest (a few years ago when a
   high-yield savings account paid 2% at best). I could barely get any of
   my Soldiers to participate in that - or contribute tax-free pay to a
   Roth IRA. Even the basics of just putting in enough money to their 401k
   to get the free 5% match was a challenge. I drove a car that cost $3k
   and was making more money than almost any of them. But they would come
   to drill in trucks that cost $40k+ while working a job making less than
   that per year.
   You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

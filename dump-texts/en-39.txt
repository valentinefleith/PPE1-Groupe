   I'm thinking about specializing in these fields and even trying to
   become an "authorized" translator in my country, but only for money
   issues since I'm not actually that interested in law. Authorization
   requires both legal and financial specialization, so I need to figure
   out if it's worth all the studying.

   If you aren't particularly interested in law or finance, won't there be
   others who are passionate about those sectors (or at least very
   interested in them) who will be able to outshine you, if only in their
   enthusiastic marketing? Meanwhile, you'll be spending maybe 30 hours a
   week for the next 30 years translating texts that don't particularly
   interest you.
   Those of you who specialize in the legal or financial area, how much
   more are you usually able to charge for this, compared to less
   specialized translation jobs?
   Bear in mind that many legal and financial texts aren't considered to
   be particularly specialised by many agencies and many translators. A
   contract is a contract is a contract, after all. Are they really that
   well-paid? I don't know as I never touch either sector if I can help
   it, although regular clients do sometimes get me to. I suspect that the
   majority of the work doesn't pay much better than the average market
   rate for 'general' translations. The high rates will likely be reserved
   for those texts to be used in situations where accuracy is worth paying
   for, by clients who realise that you do actually have to pay more for
   quality.
   I'm wondering why you've been specialising so far in sports texts. Is
   it simply that the work you were offered was in the sports sector
   (which is a valid reason), or do you have a real interest in that area?
   If it really interests you, you already seem to have a solid background
   in it, plus a great reference from a well-known client. Maybe you'll
   find clients that will pay handsomely for top-quality sports
   translations in your pairs - that's certainly been my experience. I
   also find the same to be true in the marketing and even the tourism
   sectors. Yes, there are vast numbers of clients wanting tourism
   translations for peanuts, but there are others who are appalled by the
   general quality of tourism translations and are happy to pay more for
   polished ones.

   What Sheila said
       Sep 21, 2017
   Do what you enjoy, Anna.
   Translating out of Swedish, there is no premium for translating law or
   finance if you work with agencies. Every Tom, Dick and Sven claim they
   can do contracts and accounts.
   That said, if you really know your stuff and can find direct clients
   that need quality, you can charge a lot more. But they can be hard to
   find.

   Fun or well-paid and in demand, that's the question
                                          Sep 21, 2017
   Thanks for your replies, Sheila and Chris.

   Well, that is what I'm trying to find out [icon_smile.gif] If I was to
   have an important contract involving large sums of money translated, I
   would be quite keen to have the job done correctly.
   What I want to do? I'd love to go all-in on subtitling, if it wasn't so
   badly paid compared to other forms of translation (at least in
   Swedish). I started specializing in sports because that work was
   offered to me, and continued because I liked it and because I keep
   getting work in it. Sometimes you only start liking a subject once you
   learn more about it, I am hoping that this would be my case with law. I
   think in choosing a specialization, I cannot only consider what I think
   is most fun, but also what the market looks like. That's why I started
   this thread.
   Chris, you have specialized in economics/finance (an area which I do
   actually find interesting, more so than law). Do I understand your
   comment correctly that you chose this out of personal interest, and not
   for higher pay? Or was it because you saw a demand for it? Do you think
   that you would be equally well off (financially) translating, say,
   tourist information?

   If you think there's no premium for finance or legal, I think you don't
   know how low rates can
   be for general translation even for languages like English, German and
   Dutch: some agencies offer rates as low as 0.03-0.04 euro.It's true
   that if you translate for non specialized agencies, it will be
   difficult to claim a premium compared to technical translations
   (engineering). But technical translation
   is not what you would call general translation. If you work for upscale
   agencies specialized in legal and financial translation, you may get
   rates above 0.1 euro. (the kind of rates you'll never get from
   other agencies). But it's not always a good deal because sentences can
   be very complicated so it's more difficult to translate. It may be more
   time-consuming in some instances. You have to keep in mind that you
   hourly earnings are the hourly rate* number of words you can translate
   in 1 hour.
   Your hourly rate may be higher but it's partially offset by the fact
   that your turnaround is adversely affected. On the other hand, I think
   it's good to be on the higher segments because MT is unable yet to
   translate highly complex sentences. If you don't manage to get a
   significant premium, I think it's pointless to translate financial and
   legal documents.

   There is a premium for law/finance but it depends on the customer

   Hi Anna,
   I specialise in law & finance, and in my experience, there is a premium
   even from agencies. It really depends on the actual nature of the
   agency's business, who their clients are and how they cultivate their
   customer relationships. For example, my highest paying agency client
   has a magic circle law firm as its end client, and when I am on a job
   for this client, the PM even pays me more than the (already high) rate
   I have entered in the database because neither she nor her ... See more
   Hi Anna,
   I specialise in law & finance, and in my experience, there is a premium
   even from agencies. It really depends on the actual nature of the
   agency's business, who their clients are and how they cultivate their
   customer relationships. For example, my highest paying agency client
   has a magic circle law firm as its end client, and when I am on a job
   for this client, the PM even pays me more than the (already high) rate
   I have entered in the database because neither she nor her client
   apparently care about money. I don't ask her to do this, she just
   automatically always gives me the most that she is able to. I am
   guessing she does this because the client is so important for them that
   it's more important that I am happy so that I do a very careful and
   good job.
   And law is not just contracts and accounts. Opinions, judgments and
   pleadings are often really difficult because they need prior legal
   research of what is going on in the two jurisdictions before you can
   make certain translation decisions. These cross-border matters are not
   always so well-defined, they are still in their process and being
   worked out in the real world, so as a translator, you are often having
   to deal with what is a quite messy reality but still have to produce
   feasible solutions, and usually under a big time pressure. The clients
   know this and will pay.
   Law can be fun if you are a natural type for it. You must like the
   intellectual challenge and pressure. As the others have said, you
   should choose something where you have a natural passion. You will
   really need that when you are marketing yourself to potential
   customers. But you are right that you also have to be practical. You
   should basically figure out if you are the technical type (seems
   already you are not), the corporate type (law/finance), the creative
   type (marketing, tourism, sports, etc.) or the pure literary type. Each
   type has its challenges but it is possible to be successful in any of
   them if you have the skills and ability. ▲ Collapse

   David, thanks for sharing your experience. Good point about
   legal/financial texts being more time-consuming due to complex sentence
   structures - in the end, what counts is how much we earn per hour.
   Phyllis, your message is very interesting, thanks for sharing! I'll

   To answer your question...
                 Sep 21, 2017
   I charge about 25% more per word for legal work than for general topics
   and my clients are fine with that. As David pointed out, this type of
   work demands great precision and can be very time-consuming. Sometimes
   you may spend more hours than you had anticipated but no matter how
   difficult the document is, you are keen to figure it out and do your
   best on it. I agree with what others have said: you should not (maybe
   never) do anything just for the money. You need to be interested and

   if you are interested in it and getting work, and do some subtitling on
   the side? Who knows what may come your way?

   Why not both?
    Sep 21, 2017
   Many (most) translators have more than one area of expertise. It's not
   an either/or situation. Hone your skills and gain experience in both.
   This way, the next time a client needs subtitles for a feature-length
   legal thriller about a complicated financial scheme that ruined
   millions of lives, you'll be the perfect candidate [icon_smile.gif]

   Finally a voice of reason

   And law is not just contracts and accounts. Opinions, judgments and
   pleadings are often really difficult because they need prior legal
   research of what is going on in the two jurisdictions before you can
   make certain translation decisions. These cross-border matters are not
   always so well-defined, they are still in their process and being
   worked out in the real world, so as a translator, you are often having
   to deal with what is a quite messy reality but still have to produce
   feasible solutions, and usually under a big time pressure. The clients
   know this and will pay.
   If only I could get a dollar for every translator I have come across
   over the past thirty years who claimed to specialize in law and finance
   yet couldn't put a sentence together properly in their target language,
   I'd be a rich man and retired from this business altogether.
   Disclaimer: I do specialize in law, finance, investments and
   accounting.

   I agree that it's not an either/or situation
                                   Sep 22, 2017
   Thanks for your replies, Tina and MK2010! I'm definitely not leaving
   sports translation behind, neither giving up on subtitling! I'm not
   looking to have one single specialization, at least not for the moment.
   Rather, I'm looking at different alternatives, considering both what I
   like to do, what there is a market demand for and what pays off. It's
   good to work with what you like, but it's also good to just work a
   couple of (well-paid) hours a day and do whatever you like the rest of
   the time < span>... See more

   Chris, you have specialized in economics/finance (an area which I do
   actually find interesting, more so than law). Do I understand your
   comment correctly that you chose this out of personal interest, and not
   for higher pay? Or was it because you saw a demand for it? Do you think
   that you would be equally well off (financially) translating, say,
   tourist information?
   I didn't choose economics for the money, but it has turned out quite
   lucrative, which is nice.
   I think you can command good rates in any field at all if (a) you're
   very good at it, and (b) you can find sufficiently discerning and
   deep-pocketed customers.
   I'm not sure there is such a thing as "general" translation. But there
   is such a thing as "workmanlike" translation. People (especially
   agencies) seem to confuse the two.
   I actually think translating tourist texts is very difficult and a
   perfectly valid specialist field which deserves to be highly
   remunerated. Alas, normally it is not. But if you can find the right
   customers, ones who can appreciate quality, it still can be...
   It's all about matching the right translator with the right customer,
   which is what agencies ought to do, rather than just driving down
   prices and quality, blah blah blah...
   Lycka till!

   A search at the home of Mayor Eric Adams’s fund-raising chief sought
   information about a so-called straw donor scheme.

   It is a type of scheme that took down New York’s lieutenant governor
   last year, and sank the 2013 mayoral campaign of a top Democratic
   contender: the use of so-called straw donors to funnel illegal
   contributions to candidates from secret sources.

   Now, for the second time, the campaign of Mayor Eric Adams is being
   scrutinized for the same thing.

   On Thursday, the F.B.I. searched the home of Brianna Suggs, Mr. Adams’s
   chief fund-raiser, as part of an investigation into whether his
   campaign had received illegal foreign campaign contributions from the
   Turkish government and Turkish nationals, disguised as coming from U.S.
   donors who had not actually given their own money, according to a
   search warrant.

   And in July, six men were indicted in Manhattan in connection with a
   similar scheme, accused of funneling thousands to Mr. Adams’s campaign.
   Two brothers have pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor conspiracy charge in
   the case, and the news outlet The City and other organizations have
   found additional inconsistencies in donations to the mayor’s campaign.

   Neither Mr. Adams nor Ms. Suggs has been accused of wrongdoing, and Mr.
   Adams has denied any knowledge of illegal contributions. But both
   investigations appear to be focused on whether donors who were eager to
   get Mr. Adams’s attention sought to mask large donations by funneling
   them through straw donors — and on who might have coordinated that
   effort.

Claim your money back

   Hello!
   My mom called me this morning and asked me to do grocery shopping for
   her. She had not given me the money so she suggested I use my own
   pocket money to do the shopping and she would give the money back to me
   when she returned home. This is what she said:
   1. Please do the grocery shopping. You can claim your money back.
   That sounds quite odd to me.
   Do native speakers use it in this way?
   If not, what do you say?
   Thanks!

   It's definitely odd in the context of doing shopping for your mother,
   yes. I'd have said "I'll give you the money back."

   What about if my boss asks me to buy a coffee for him and he promises
   to give me money back, can he say that?
   Thanks again!

   Since it would be more or less in the nature of a social request, it's
   the same principle as your mother's shopping: "I'll give you the money
   back".
   If on the other hand the office has run out of pens, he might ask you
   to go out to the shops and buy some, get a receipt and then "You can
   claim your money back".

   I agree with DonnyB.
   "You can claim your money back" sounds too formal and a bit abstract
   for a personal arrangement.
   It does not say WHERE the money can be claimed back from thus hinting
   that it isn't necessarily the person who is saying it.
   Using "claimed" might suggest that a request would have to be be
   submitted eg fill in a formal expense or petty cash claim form and
   submitting it to a manager or finance office clerk.

   I understand.
   But I think the "back" is needed right? We cannot not say it. Right?

   In AE, we would be much more likely to say "I'll pay you back."
   "I'll give you your money back" sounds as though I had your money in
   the first place: perhaps you gave me some money to buy something for
   you, and I couldn't do so. That's when I'd use that phrase.

   Yes. Whatever phrase you use, you need to somehow include the idea of
   "back", because you paid out the money in the first place.

   You do not need to say "back," but you do need the concept, which can
   be expressed in many ways.
   See, for example: reimburse or repay

Profits Using Profits Maximiser Programme

How to Become a Betfair Scalper is a Betfair method that uses a scalping
technique to scrape profits from all the horse races before the races have
even begin. It is claimed that you can make excellent profits.


   From Home Business Direct (homebusinessdirect.co.uk) Using your
   computer, you will be taught how to take advantage of how much money is
   entering the Betfair market at specific times BEFORE an event. Using
   the fact that most people who use Betfair have no idea what they are
   doing, users of Betfair Scalper will be able to set ‘traps’ to
   manipulate where the money is going, and then consistently make
   multiple profits throughout the day, without anybody even noticing.
   What you will be doing, is scalping, or creaming a percentage of the
   money being placed BEFORE an event has even taken place.

How does Betfair Scalper work?

   The product is a detailed video tutorial, together with an in-depth
   manual that will teach users how to set a method up whereby profits can
   be made before an event, say a horse race, football match, has even
   taken place. Using specific software from a Windows computer (a
   computer is needed Betfair Scalper Review Online Now for this, not a
   tablet, remember to make more professional, you must act
   professionally, and a tablet will not cut it for this!).

   Scalping on Betfair is not new, but we have yet to find such a
   comprehensive training course that can, and will take users by the hand
   and teach them everything they need to know.

   This Betfair scalping product includes complete video examples on how
   to make profits, how to set everything up, what to do when things go
   wrong (and they sometimes do, in all trading), as well deciding if you
   actually enjoy generating revenue this way.

   Scalping works by entering trades before the horse races begin, and
   then using methods, you will be scraping small profits from the
   liquidity entering the market before the main activity starts, and
   definitely before the race begins.

   Scalping is quite a relaxed way of making money compared to many of the
   systems out there. It is simply a case of time that you have to invest
   after you learn how it is done.

Contents of The Betfair Scalping Course?

   You gain access to the scalping members area that teaches you from the
   very beginning, even if you are new to trading. The sections are
   detailed into the following:
     * Start Here

     * Betangel Use

     * Basic Scalping Profits

     * Member Feedback

     * Advanced Scalping

     * Further Trading

     * Latest Information

   The course contains over 7+ hours of HD video content that is aimed at
   teaching you how to trade the markets, and the Betfair Exchanges to a
   point of making a profit.

   The first videos on the course teach you all about the mindset needed,
   what to expect from the course, how to use the software, the settings,
   and then the very basics you need to get started, and then you have a
   section on the actual strategies, and scalping signals you will be
   using to take advantage and profit.

   There is also a members section where feedback and emails/questions are
   shared with other members using videos, which digs into the actual
   detail of some of the more not obvious questions.

   Then later on in the course, there is a video section on advanced
   trading to further increase your profits. These also include taking
   races in play on Betfair, and increasing profit on top of what you have
   already made, which is taught as being risk free.

                                      .

Initial investment of Betfair Scalper?

   £89.97 – Although when considering how much the investment is, as
   always, you will need to weigh up the earning potential of what is
   being offered, as well as the money back guarantee offered by the
   vendor. There are many Betfair products online that don’t come anywhere
   near to the quality that this scalping course offers, and continues to
   be increased almost daily.

   What you should also consider, is the amount of products you have
   probably purchased over the years that have not worked, and then
   consider the true value of a product and course that does work. Also
   remember that there is a LOT of content contained in this course and a
   lot of instruction with well over 7 hours of video tutorials filmed in
   HD format for quality viewing.

   The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for this products, which
   we believe makes it a snip at the price.

What is the rate of return?

   The rate of return is advertised as the user making up to £40 , £50+
   per day, depending on their betting bank. Although new users can expect
   to make upwards of £30 per day with reasonable stakes when they have
   learned how to scalp efficiently.


   betfair scalper and Scalping profits


   The course also teaches you how to scale the profits up when you have
   practiced enough and have enough experience. This will be the same for
   any type of trading product in that you have to elarn the process
   first, learn how the trading works, and then find a style that suits
   you based on that same experience.

   There are now reports and screenshots of members making upwards of
   £100+ per day as you can see from the image on the right which is a
   customer who sent in a screenshot of their profits from their Betfair
   account

   Scalping is a very good way of producing profits on a daily basis when
   you have learned how it works, as you are taking small amounts of money
   from the betting exchanges on every race, so it is really is up to you
   as to how much time you wish to spend doing this.

   We have probably produced more reviews than anything else on the topic
   of Betfair, and some are amusingly bad in their execution, but some are
   far better than others at explaining the concepts and strategies needed
   when trying to make a profit from Betfair, and this is one of them
   without a doubt.

How Much Money Do I Need To Start?

   The website states that you can actually start with a low betting bank
   and then increase this same betting bank with your profits. It also
   states that you can specify and choose particular races based around
   the betting banks. The following video explains this further:

Will The Betfair Scalper Course Work For Me?

   Trading is not for everybody, it takes time, dedication and a
   willingness to prepare yourself for what is required in order to follow
   a strict training plan.

   That said, compared to some of the outrageous claims made online for
   other products, scalping is one product that simply does work, and does
   not take that much investment to get started. You will of course need
   to be prepared to put some real effort in, but the returns are there.

   Many people make a profit from Betfair this way, so as long as you put
   the time in then there is no reason it cannot work for you. You will
   not be a fully experienced Betfair trader after watching all the
   videos, sure you will know what to do, but then you have to practice
   what you will have learned and spend the time it takes to learn all
   about the signals and as the course states a lot: practice.

   There are many claiming that it is one of the best Betfair trading
   courses brought to market, and we would agree with that assumption.

Conclusion on The Betfair Scalping Course

   This is an excellent product, and as long as you have a Windows
   computer, then together with the money back guarantee, you have nothing
   to lose really. Remember though, that as with any trading opportunity,
   you can only make money if you have the time to dedicate yourself to
   what is being taught.

   The teachings in the video course are clear, concise and extremely
   detailed regarding how to make a profit from Betfair, and the emails we
   get back on the product and Betfair Scalper course have a common theme,
   in that customers love the course and the way it is laid out.

Where Can I Buy The Scalping Course?

   The price is also on £89.97 –  and relatively cheap at the price for
   the quality course materials you gain access to.

   Dear Members,

   We have been present, and involved in testing the product over the last
   few months, and we must say, this looks to be one of the easiest, and
   most low risk, low pressure trading/gambling methods we have ever come
   across.

   We have videoed 11 trades using this over the last 2 days, and there
   have been 10 wins and 1 loss, with a profit margin of £63.83. This has
   represented a profit of £5.80 per race traded, and when you consider
   that there are approximately 20 races per day in the UK and Ireland,
   that could be a potential profit of £41,000+ per year.

   Time is needed to generate the profits with this, but the upside is
   that there is virtually no pressure as the betting bank is never at
   risk.

   To give a quick example, the profits made over the last 2 days were:

   Race 1: £5.13 won
   Race 2: £5.60 won
   Race 3: £5.95 won
   Race 4: £7.78 won
   Race 5: £6.40 lost
   Race 6: £4.01 won
   Race 7: £10.86 won
   Race 8: £5.17 won
   Race 9: £7.79 won
   Race 10: £4.74 won
   Race 11: £12.80 won

   The profits represented a yearly increase on the betting bank of over
   1,600%, which the author stated was an average figure for his students
   when following these scalping methods – now try getting that in
   interest from your bank!

   There is also no chasing losses, or particular staking plan, due to the
   low risk. How much profit is made is directly linked to the amount of
   betting bank available, but as already mentioned the betting bank is
   never at risk.

   The product is a complete video training course, together with detailed
   manual amongst the video, on how to make these daily profits using
   Betfair.

   We are very excited by this one, to add to our other guaranteed ways to
   generate an online income.

   Probably. It’s a professional course teaching you a method that is
   dependent on the market and not dependent on a specific software, so
   you would need a trading software (any) that has the “enchanced ladder”
   mode, and all trading softwares have it. You would probably have no
   problem if you use, for example, Geeks Toy.

   Betangel is by far the most preferred by professionals, and the most
   detailed, that’s why they are using it, and it is truly magnificent.

   Good luck in your trading journey.

   Hello Ian,

   Good question.

   Scalping is about profiting from 1 or more positions, and therefore the
   stake needed is higher than a direct bet, BUT, the stake is never at
   risk, due to the fact all the scalping is done before play.

   For example, a stake of £300 may be required to make, say £5 inside a
   few minutes, but that £300 is never at risk, all we are doing is
   ‘using’ the weight of the bank, as a means to an end – profit, not
   risking the bank.

   If you are familiar with Betfair you will know that if laying a trade,
   for example, even before play, that Betfair will take the liability for
   once the race has concluded, but because the races never ever go in
   play, we do not risk the bank – ever.

   Basically, no matter what size betting bank somebody has, profits can
   be made. The higher the bank the higher the profits, but with say a 5%
   compounded profit per day even the smallest of betting banks would
   quickly become substantial in a small period of time.

   We have been testing this ourselves, and are very impressed with the
   results. The only variable we have found that is not in the user’s
   control is the odds on certain horses, but that is not even an issue,
   because the stakes can be increased to compensate, and again, as the
   bank is never at risk, there is even some degree of control to that
   also.

   Regards,

   Admin.

   Hi Guys, how subjective is the method, does it tell you which race,
   horse, entry and exit points?Must say it looks very consistent.Does it
   only work on horses or can it be used on other sports as well?
   Many thanks

   Hi again, Ian.

   It is fairly subjective. There are definite entry and exit points, and
   what we are finding is that approximately 8 times out of 10 the profits
   are fairly easy, and just happens almost to the letter, and the other 2
   times are what we have started calling ‘variable’ trades as it takes a
   little longer to gain the profit, but yes, the win-to-lose ratio is
   highly stacked in the favour of the scalping method.

   Without giving the information away ( which could also confuse ) the
   scalping method entails laying ‘traps’ in the market around 10 minutes
   before the race when the market is fairly static and then capitalising
   before the start of each race when the liquidity (money) floods into
   the market creating movement on the price.

   Hi Max,

   The betting bank can be as small as you want really, you would just
   start making smaller profits but can then build up using those same
   profits to increase your betting bank.

   really ticked the right boxes on what to actually do. I am not trading
   live yet as I am still practising but if you are interested in a proper

   Hello Cat,

   Thank you, and I agree that there is a lot of content to be able to
   train newbies how to scalp the markets.

   There are already many reports, and emails from customers of the
   product being extremely satisfied with the content.

   Regards,

   Coming from match betting this was good for me as all my bonuses were
   drying up and finding it harder to make money. This scalping course has
   been excellent so far. I started it the last week in feb and starting
   to make some consistent profits already. Today for example I have
   already done £68 which I am well pleased with.

   You won’t go wrong with this one.

   Hi,

   Stuart is one of the best trainers I have come across in a long while.
   It taught me how to use the software also, which I needed, and steadily
   making some money with it after learning it all. Just one thing I would
   like to say. There is a LOT of videos and learning to do but it is all
   done in a nice way, I really enjoyed the videos. Start small and then
   increase that is what I did and it is working really well for me know.

   In the last 7 days I have made profits of about £280 after Betfair
   takes their 5% from me so I am pleased. I will stick with the same
   stakes for a few weeks like the tell you and then move up to increase
   them and then increase the profits.

   Very enjoyable.

   Tom

   Hi Tom,

   That is brilliant. £280 for a week is a great start.

   We were looking at the course again only last week, and it has gained
   rave reviews by all concerned.

   Since we first looked at it when it launched, the content must have
   increased 100 fold, and now has about 10 hours of training. I agree
   with you also, it is a very professional course, and put together very
   well so that it can be followed by anybody.

   Regards,

   I am still learning this but I started a few quick trades over the
   weekend, and made a profit on all but one of them, and the one that
   didn’t make a profit was a break even,. very well demonstrated and
   Stuart is very good with the videos. Answers quickly to even at
   weekends as I asked him a question and he answered at 9pm at night,
   which I didn’t expect. Still going through it all but the fact I have
   already made a profit following what it says is very encouraging. Far
   more bang for your buck than I thought I was getting and definitely
   over delivers. My brother in law started it yesterday also after I told
   him about it, as we did match betting together for a few years and
   wanted the step up, and we both like this trading product a lot.

   This is well worth it providing you can put the time in. It took me a
   while but I am now making regular profits. They update it and add to it
   as well which was a nice surprise at no extra cost.

   Hi admin (Simon, it says in email?),

   I just wanted to put my comment here after getting the email from you
   about it in February. I did spend the required months learning and
   practising as Stuart advises and after using many courses over the last
   10 years or so and wasting huge amounts of capital trying to learn
   trading I really have to say that the value in this course is
   incredible.

   The main problem with most courses is that those presenting them do not
   go into enough detail to make a profit, or to show you what they do to
   make a profit. Stuart is the opposite, he shows you straight away how
   to make a profit and you watch him doing it live.

   Not only that but Stuart breaks it all down into micro segments so that
   you can easily understand it. No other course that I have paid into
   goes even remotely close to the detail given in this course content.

   I’ll give you an example on how I am progressing. This week so far
   including the weekend I have completed 47 trades, 42 of them have been
   profits, 2 losing trades and a few scratch trades. Stuart also teaches
   you about taking them in play to increase profits which is something I
   am doing more and more of. I love that concept.

   So after 8 months on the course, I am making regular profits where I
   have never done this before. This week I have made approximately £236
   after Betfair commissions, so when you bear in mind that I have never
   made a profit before from any course, this is the only content that has
   taught me how to consistently make a profit.

   I was showing my brother in law this Scalper course and how I was using
   it a few weeks ago, and he has now started the course himself and is
   equally impressed. He is not making a profit yet as he has only just
   started with it, but we discuss it on Skype all the time during the day
   as we are both retired and have time. We both did matched betting for a
   few years so we tell our better halves that is what we are doing, but
   the progress cannot be bettered in my opinion.

   Both my wife’s and my own car insurance was due for renewal on the 22nd
   of this month, and I paid for both of both in advance which saves
   interest payments, and paid for them both with profits from this
   trading. It is the first time I have paid for car insurance in bulk,
   and usually do it monthly.

   My wife still works part time at the local school, but my trading is
   going so well now that I have already suggested that she could give
   that up soon as the profits I make easily eclipses the minimum pay she
   gets. She enjoys the job but health wise it is not good for her.

   We also have 6 grand children now, and with Christmas coming up we know
   that we will be in a much better financial position that I can remember
   us being in for many a year.

   Go figure. A brilliant product, and brilliantly executed by a very good
   teacher.

   Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

   Hi, it is an excellent course so thanks for the write up on it.

   I have tried caan berry and badger and a few others and this betfair
   scalper course blows them all out of the water. as it actually explains
   what to do which is what was missed from all the others. I can now see
   where I was going wrong with others. I started to make small profits
   already and cannot wait to really get my teeth into scaling up for the
   future. Defo the real deal. John

   Having spent much of Chrimbo studying this course I have to say I am
   loving it. Stuart’s explanations are second the none from what I can
   see. He goes into a lot of detail and detail that you need.

   I have not started live trading yet but from my practising I can
   already see why what he teaches will work well. It was a Chrimbo
   pressie to myself and probably the best money I spent over any other
   presents bought in December.

   It teaches you to take your time so that is what I will be doing.
   Loving it so far though!!

   I am a few months down the line with this betfair course and it has
   been a revelation in opening my eyes to trading. The course is laid
   out, or was laid out for me as a newcomer in an easy to use fashion and
   the detail it goes into is incredible. I like many others have tried
   various other topic course by the usual names but nothing remotely
   came, or comes close to this course. Here are a few points from me on
   this course:-

   1) Great for a newbie like me.
   2) Very responsive emails if you need them (I did).
   3) Easy enough to learn (I like the structure).
   4) The best explanations I ever watched (easily!)
   5) Stuart (who does the videos) is clearly passionate about wanting it
   to work for you (rare!)
   6) The course explains at length the entry and exit and why you are
   entering trades (rare!)
   7) It works, and I am now at around 92% success win rate after 3 months
   (and a bit).

   My observations from a newcomer to Betfair:-

   1) You will have to learn (obvious!)
   2) It takes time for it all to sink in (it did me anyway!)
   3) The training is very logical (which I needed!)
   4) Make sure you go back through the vids after practising (helps it
   sink in more!)
   5) Do not take trades in play (they teach you this early on!)

   At the price they sell this material at, it is a steal, and I am making
   regularly profits from what I have learned, but I still continue to go
   back through the videos most days, with more videos added all the time.
   Great product, great guys.

   Hi all, just to give my 2 pence worth on this product.

   Stuart is very, very good at explaining how to trade, and knows his
   stuff. The feedback section is also good to see how others are getting
   on with this. I started pretty slowly in September last year as a
   member and it did take me a while to get to grips with it (I am 68
   years old) and I also left it alone for a while, but went back to it
   last month and started again, and I am now doing very nicely.
   I still use smallish stakes but just yesterday I was trading live and
   out of 17 trades I made 16 profits and one break even, and the day
   before that I completed 14 trades with 12 wins, one small loss, and a
   break even so I am pleased with the progress. Very enjoyable too I had
   to add.

   Easily the best online course I have ever had the pleasure of being a
   part of.

   Finally somebody who does actually show you the edges you need to
   trade.

   Some of the earlier stuff I knew about as I have been trading a while,
   good for anyone new to this lark though, but as you go through the
   course the nuggets of trading info on the videos of how it is explained
   is remarkably detailed.

   Best £90 I ever spent and that is coming from somebody who has spent
   years and years on failed promises. Although the videos have turned my
   trading around. One video is particular was eye opening and shown me
   where I had been going wrong when trading a certain market, I tried
   what was suggested and made an 80% increase in profit, to say I was
   surprised would be an understatement. Stuart who made it knows exactly
   what he is doing.

   Betfair is mentioned frequently. I am with Betdaq. Would Betdaq do
   everything that Betfair does?

   Hi Geoff,

   There is not enough liquidity in Betdaq as of yet, which is why the
   author recommends Betfair.

   I would say that Betdaq is mainly used by matched bettors, whilst this
   Betfair course is pre race trading, and needs the money that Betfair
   offers.

   Admin

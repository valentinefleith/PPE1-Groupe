How to find unclaimed money from the government

   Find unclaimed funds held by the government that might be owed to you.

What is unclaimed money?

   If a business, financial institution, or government owes you money that
   you did not collect, it is considered unclaimed money or property.

   You may be able to file for unclaimed money owed to you or that was
   owed to a deceased relative if you are their legal heir.

Search by state

   Most unclaimed money is held by state governments from sources such as
   bank accounts, insurance policies, or state agencies.

   Search for unclaimed money from your [34]state’s unclaimed property
   office. If you have lived in other states, check their unclaimed
   property offices, too.

Search other databases

   There is no single government database for all unclaimed money. Use
   each separate database in the links below to search for each type of
   unclaimed money.

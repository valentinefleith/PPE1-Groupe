Financial counselling

   Free help to sort out your money problems

   Page reading time: 2 minutes
   (BUTTON) On this page

   Financial counselling is a free and confidential service offered by
   not-for-profit community organisations.

   Financial counsellors do not offer legal advice. If you’re facing legal
   action, get free legal advice straight away.

What financial counsellors do

   Financial counsellors are skilled professionals who provide advice and
   support to people struggling with bills and debt. A financial
   counsellor can:
     * assess your financial situation
     * provide advice about what to do if you're struggling to pay bills
       and fines
     * help you negotiate with government agencies, your landlord,
       utilities, telcos, and other creditors
     * assist you if you're being harassed by debt collectors
     * refer you to other services you might need, such as legal,
       accommodation, health and crisis services

   Read more about what financial counsellors do.

   Never pay for financial counselling. Businesses that charge fees for
   this are debt consolidation and refinancing companies.

   as possible. If you get help early, you will have many more options.

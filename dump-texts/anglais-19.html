Get help with the cost of living

   This advice applies to England. See advice for [24]See advice for
   Northern Ireland, [25]See advice for Scotland, [26]See advice for Wales

   If you don’t have enough money to live on, you might be able to get
   help to afford essentials like bills and food. This includes the
   Household Support Fund and cost of living payments.

   You should check if you can claim benefits - you might be able to do
   this even if you work, have savings or own a home.

If you owe money and you're struggling to pay

   You should speak to the organisations you owe money to – they might let
   you pay smaller amounts or take a break from payments.

   Don’t ignore bills or letters about money you owe.

   You can [27]find out how to start dealing with your debts.

Check what benefits you can get

   Lots of people miss out on benefits they’re entitled to - so it’s worth
   checking what you can get.

   Claiming benefits might also let you get access to other financial help
   like cost of living payments and discounts on energy and transport.

   You might be able to claim benefits or increase your current benefits
   if you’re:
     * over 16 years old with a low income or no income
     * sick or disabled, including if you have a mental health condition
     * of State Pension age with a low income or no income
     * a carer
     * responsible for children

   [28]Check what benefits you can get.

Get your first benefit payment early

   When you apply for benefits, you might be able to get your first
   payment early while you’re waiting for either:
     * a decision on your application
     * your first payment

   This is called a 'short-term benefit advance'. You can get an advance
   for:
     * Universal Credit
     * Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
     * Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
     * Carer’s Allowance
     * Pension Credit
     * State Pension

   You’ll need to pay back the advance. The Department for Work and
   Pensions (DWP) will take an amount off your future payments until
   you've paid it back. For Universal Credit, you can spread the
   repayments over 24 months. For other benefits, you’ll usually repay
   your advance over 12 weeks.

   If you've applied for Universal Credit, you can [29]check how to get a
   Universal Credit advance payment.

   If you’ve applied for a different benefit, contact the benefits office
   that's dealing with your claim. You can find their contact details on
   any letter or email you’ve had from them.

Check if you'll get a Cost of Living Payment

   The government will send you a 'Cost of Living Payment' if you:
     * get a benefit based on your income - for example, Universal Credit,
       Pension Credit, or tax credits
     * get a disability benefit - for example, Personal Independence
       Payment
     * are over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments

   You’ll get 1 Cost of Living Payment for each type of benefit you get.
   For example, if you get Universal Credit, Personal Independence
   Payment, and Winter Fuel Payments, you’ll get 3 Cost of Living
   Payments.

   If you’re not claiming benefits yet, you should [30]check if you can
   claim benefits. It's worth starting a claim as soon as possible if
   you're eligible - this means you might be able to get Cost of Living
   Payments in the future.

If you get benefits based on your income

   If you’re eligible, the government will send you a payment of £300 in
   autumn 2023 - you'll get this by 19 November.

   To get the £300 payment you must have:
     * been entitled to a benefits payment on any day from 18 August to 17
       September 2023
     * started a successful claim for Universal Credit by 18 August
     * started a successful claim for another income-based benefit by 17
       September 2023

   The government will send you another payment of £299 during spring 2024
   if you’re still eligible.

   The government have already given 3 Cost of Living Payments to people
   who get certain benefits.

If you didn't get the last Cost of Living Payment

   You should have got a payment of £301 by 17 May 2023 if you get any of
   the following benefits:
     * Universal Credit
     * Pension Credit
     * Working Tax Credit
     * Child Tax Credit
     * income-based Jobseekers Allowance
     * income-related Employment and Support Allowance
     * Income Support

   You’ll have only got one £301 payment - even if you get more than 1 of
   these benefits.

   To get the latest payment you must have either:
     * received a benefits payment at any point between 5 April and 17 May
       2023
     * started a successful benefit claim between 5 April and 17 May 2023

   If you’re waiting for a decision on your benefits claim, you won’t get
   the Cost of Living Payment until your claim is successful.

   If your benefits are paid to someone else, like your landlord, you
   should still have got the Cost of Living Payment.

   If you think you should have received a Cost of Living Payment, you
   can [31]report a missing payment on GOV.UK.

If you get a disability benefit

   The government gave a £150 Cost of Living Payment to people getting
   disability benefits between 20 June and 4 July 2023.

   You would have been eligible for this one-off payment if you get any of
   the following benefits:
     * Disability Living Allowance
     * Personal Independence Payment
     * Attendance Allowance
     * Armed Forces Independence Payment
     * Constant Attendance Allowance
     * War Pension Mobility Supplement

   To get this payment you must have:
     * been getting one of these benefits on 1 April 2023
     * applied for one of these benefits by 1 April 2023 - you won't get
       the payment until your claim is successful

If you haven't received a previous Cost of Living Payment

   If you think you should have received a Cost of Living Payment, you
   can [32]report a missing payment on GOV.UK.

If you're over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments

   You'll either get a £300 or £150 Cost of Living Payment, depending on
   your situation. You'll get this at the same time as your usual Winter
   Fuel Payment from November 2023.

   You’ll get a £300 Cost of Living Payment if you live either:
     * on your own
     * with people who don’t qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment

   If you live with someone else who qualifies for the Winter Fuel
   Payment, the amount you’ll get depends on whether either of you get any
   of the following:
     * Pension Credit
     * income-related Employment Support Allowance
     * income-based Jobseeker's Allowance

   If either you or the person you live with gets one of these benefits,
   you’ll both get £300 - as long as you’re not partners. If you’re
   partners, you’ll only get one £300 payment.

   If neither of you gets one of these benefits, you’ll both get £150.

   If you live in residential care and qualify for the Winter Fuel
   Payment, you'll get £150 unless you get any of these benefits.

Check if you need to apply for Winter Fuel Payments

   You're usually entitled to Winter Fuel Payments if you’re of State
   Pension age in the third week of September. The State Pension age is
   66.

   You should start getting the Winter Fuel Payment automatically once you
   reach State Pension age. You might need to apply if you're in one of
   these situations:
     * you don't get State Pension
     * you don't get another benefit
     * you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein

   You can [33]find out how to apply for the Winter Fuel Payment on
   GOV.UK.

Get help with your energy bills

   If you’re struggling to pay your energy bills or top up your prepayment
   meter, you might be able to get help - for example a fuel voucher or a
   grant from your energy supplier.

   [34]Check if you can get help to pay your energy bills.

   You might be able to save money on your energy bills by switching to a
   different supplier, or to a different tariff with your current
   supplier. [35]Check if you can switch.

Check how to make your home more energy efficient

   If your home is energy efficient, you’ll pay less to heat your home and
   it will stay warm for longer.

   It’s a good idea to look into making your home more energy efficient at
   any time of the year. This is because it can take a few months to sort
   things out - for example, to find someone who can do the work.

   You might be able to apply for help with the cost of:
     * a new boiler
     * boiler repairs
     * loft or cavity wall insulation
     * a heat pump

   Check if you can [36]get help with the cost of energy efficiency.

If you need somewhere to stay warm

   You can ask your local council if they have information about nearby
   ‘warm spaces’. These are public places that anyone can use to stay warm
   - for example a community space like a library. You can [37]find out
   how to contact your local council on GOV.UK.

Get help with essential costs

   Your local council might help you pay for things like:
     * your energy and water bills
     * food
     * essential items - for example, clothes or an oven

   This help is known as 'welfare assistance' or the ‘Household Support
   Fund’. Each council runs their own scheme. You’ll need to check if you
   can get support and what type of support you can get.

   Ask your local council if they run a welfare assistance or Household
   Support Fund scheme. You can [38]find out how to contact your local
   council on GOV.UK.

   You don’t have to be getting benefits to get help from your local
   council. If you do get benefits, they won’t be affected if you start
   getting money from a welfare assistance or Household Support Fund
   scheme.

   There are also other things you can do if you’re struggling to afford
   essentials like rent or food.

Get help paying for rent, council tax and other bills

   There are things you can do if you’re struggling to pay your rent and
   bills.

   You can [39]check what help and support you can get with your rent and
   bills.

Get help paying for food

   If you're struggling to pay for food, you might be able to get a
   referral to a food bank.

   You can [40]find out how to get help from a food bank.

If you have a child or are pregnant

   You might be able to get a Healthy Start card to help you buy certain
   types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.

   To get the Healthy Start card you must be at least 10 weeks pregnant or
   have a child under 4 years old. You must also be getting either:
     * Universal Credit - but only if your household earns £408 a month or
       less
     * Income Support
     * income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
     * income-related Employment and Support Allowance - but only if
       you're pregnant
     * Pension Credit
     * Child Tax Credit - but only if your household earns £16,190 a year
       or less

   If you get Child Tax Credit, you can’t get the card if you also get
   Working Tax Credit - unless you get the ‘run-on’ payment. Working Tax
   Credit run-on is the payment you get for 4 weeks after you stop
   qualifying for Working Tax Credit.

   With the Healthy Start card you’ll get:
     * £4.25 each week from week 10 of your pregnancy
     * £8.50 each week for children from birth to 1 year old
     * £4.25 each week for children between 1 and 4 years old
     * free vitamins

   You can [41]apply for the Healthy Start scheme on the NHS website.

Get help with health costs

   You might be able to get help paying for NHS charges, for example:
     * prescriptions
     * dental treatment
     * sight tests, glasses and contact lenses
     * travel to NHS treatment

   [42]Check if you can get help with health costs on the NHS website.

If you pay for regular prescriptions

   If you can’t get help to pay for your prescriptions, you might be able
   to save money by buying a prepayment certificate.

   You’ll pay a fixed price for either 3 or 12 months. This will cover the
   cost of all the prescriptions you need during that time.

   You can buy a prepayment certificate for unlimited prescriptions for:
     * £31.25 for 3 months
     * £111.60 for 12 months - you can pay this in 10 instalments of
       £11.16

   You can [43]buy a prepayment certificate on the NHS website.

If you’ve been prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

   If you already have a prepayment certificate for other medicines, it
   covers the cost of your HRT.

   If you only need a certificate for HRT, you might be able to save
   money. You can get an HRT prescription prepayment certificate -  it
   costs £19.30 for 12 months.

   The certificate only covers certain HRT medicines. [44]Check if your
   HRT medicine is covered on the NHS website. If you have HRT medicines
   that aren’t covered, you’ll have to pay for them or buy a normal
   prepayment certificate.

   You can [45]buy an HRT prescription prepayment certificate on the NHS
   website.

Get help with your energy and water if you're disabled

   If you're disabled, you might be able to get extra support with your
   energy and water. You can [46]check how to get free advice about energy

   to get help with childcare costs. For example:
     * if you work and claim Universal Credit, you might be able to claim
       back up to 85% of your childcare costs - you could get up to
       £950.92 a month for 1 child under 17 or £1,630.15 for 2 or more
       children
     * if you have a 2 year old, you might be able to claim up to 15 hours

   your midwife or health visitor.

Get help with travel costs

   Contact your local council to check if they offer free or discounted
   travel - for example, if you’re:
     * in education
     * on a work placement
     * unemployed and looking for work
     * a veteran

   You can [51]find your local council on GOV.UK.

   payment options - like reducing the bill or setting up a payment plan.

   If you can’t set up an affordable payment plan, you should [58]get debt
   advice. Your vet might decide to stop treating your pet if you owe
   money.

If you’re over 55 and have a personal pension

   You might be able to take some money from your pension savings to help
   pay for essential costs or to pay off your debts.

   You should think about whether taking money from your pension is the
   best financial decision for you. Taking money from your pension will
   mean you have less income when you retire. If you’re getting benefits,
   taking money from your pension could affect your claim.

   You can [61]get free guidance on your pension options from Pension
   Wise. They’ll explain the different options so you can decide which is
   best for you.

   You should also get financial advice before taking any money from your
   pension savings - you’ll have to pay.

   You can [62]check how to find a financial adviser - they can tell you
   which option is best for you.

   health.

   Mind website.

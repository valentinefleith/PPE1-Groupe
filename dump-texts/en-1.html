   Money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people for
   the payment of goods and services, as well as the repayment of loans.
   Money makes the world go 'round. Economies rely on money to facilitate
   transactions and to power financial growth. Typically, it is economists
   who define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. Here are
   the multifaceted characteristics of money.

Key Takeaways

     * Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people and businesses to
       obtain what they need to live and thrive.
     * Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods
       before money was created.
     * Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for
       most people it represents something valuable.
     * Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a
       physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government.
     * Above all, money is a unit of account - a socially accepted
       standard unit with which things are priced.

Medium of Exchange

   Before the development of a [167]medium of exchange—that is,
   money—people would barter to obtain the goods and services they needed.
   Two individuals, each possessing some goods the other wanted, would
   enter into an agreement to trade.

   Early forms of bartering, however, do not provide the transferability
   and divisibility that makes trading efficient. For instance, if someone
   has cows but needs bananas, they must find someone who not only has
   bananas but also the desire for meat. What if that individual finds
   someone who has the need for meat but no bananas and can only offer
   potatoes? To get meat, that person must find someone who has bananas
   and wants potatoes, and so on.

   The lack of transferability of bartering for goods is tiring,
   confusing, and inefficient. But that is not where the problems end;
   even if the person finds someone with whom to trade meat for bananas,
   they may not consider a bunch of bananas to be worth a whole cow. Such
   a trade requires coming to an agreement and devising a way to determine
   how many bananas are worth certain parts of the cow.

   [168]Commodity money solved these problems. Commodity money is a type
   of good that functions as currency. In the 17th and early 18th
   centuries, for example, American colonists used beaver pelts and dried
   corn in transactions. Possessing generally accepted values, these
   commodities were used to buy and sell other things. The commodities
   used for trade had certain characteristics: they were widely desired
   and, therefore, valuable, but they were also durable, portable, and
   easily stored.

   Another, more advanced example of commodity money is a precious metal
   such as gold. For centuries, gold was used to back paper currency—up
   until the 1970s. In the case of the U.S. dollar, for example, this
   meant that foreign governments were able to take their dollars and
   exchange them at a specified rate for gold with the U.S. Federal
   Reserve. What's interesting is that, unlike the beaver pelts and dried
   corn (which can be used for clothing and food, respectively), gold is
   precious purely because people want it. It is not necessarily
   useful—you can't eat gold, and it won't keep you warm at night, but the
   majority of people think it is beautiful, and they know others think it
   is beautiful. So, gold is something that has worth. Gold, therefore,
   serves as a physical token of wealth based on people's perceptions.

   This relationship between money and gold provides insight into how
   money gains its value—as a representation of something valuable.

Impressions Create Everything

   The second type of money is [169]fiat money, which does not require
   backing by a physical commodity. Instead, the value of fiat currencies
   is set by supply and demand and people's faith in its worth. Fiat money
   developed because gold was a scarce resource, and rapidly growing
   economies growing couldn't always mine enough to back their currency
   supply requirements. For a booming economy, the need for gold to give
   money value is extremely inefficient, especially when its value is
   really created by people's perceptions.

   Fiat money becomes the token of people's perception of worth, the basis
   for why money is created. An economy that is growing is apparently
   succeeding in producing other things that are valuable to itself and
   other economies. The stronger the economy, the stronger its money will
   be perceived (and sought after) and vice versa. However, people's
   perceptions must be supported by an economy that can produce the
   products and services that people want.

   For example, beginning in 1971, the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold
   standard—the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold, and the price of
   gold was no longer fixed to any dollar amount. This was made official
   in 1976. This meant that it was now possible to create more paper money
   than there was gold to back it; the health of the U.S. economy backed
   the dollar's value. If the economy stalls, the value of the U.S. dollar
   will drop both domestically through inflation and internationally
   through currency exchange rates. The implosion of the U.S. economy
   would plunge the world into a financial dark age, so many other
   countries and entities are working tirelessly to ensure that never
   happens.

   Today, the value of money (not just the dollar, but most currencies) is
   decided purely by its [170]purchasing power, as dictated by inflation.
   That is why simply printing new money will not create wealth for a
   country. Money is created by a kind of a perpetual interaction between
   real, tangible things, our desire for them, and our abstract faith in
   what has value. Money is valuable because we want it, but we want it
   only because it can get us a desired product or service.

How Is Money Measured?

   But exactly how much money is out there, and what forms does it take?
   Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there
   is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so
   that it is more discernible for measurement purposes:
     * [171]M1 – This category of money includes all physical
       denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are
       checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers' checks. It also
       includes other forms of liquid deposits and assets such as savings
       accounts. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and
       is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments (see
       the "active money" section below).
     * [172]M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money
       found in M1 to all time-related deposits, many types of retirement
       accounts, and non-institutional money market funds. This category
       represents money that can be readily transferred into cash.
     * [173]M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found
       in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits,
       institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements,
       along with other larger liquid assets. M3 indicates a country's
       money supply or the total amount of money within an economy.

Active Money

   The M1 category includes what's known as active money—the total value
   of coins and paper currency in circulation as well as liquid deposits
   and accounts. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally,
   monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, [174]Federal Reserve
   Banks distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks
   lend money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is
   actively circulated.

   The variable demand for cash equates to a constantly fluctuating active
   money total. For example, people typically cash paychecks or withdraw
   from ATMs over the weekend, so there is more active cash on a Monday
   than on a Friday. The public demand for cash declines at certain
   times—following the December holiday season, for example.

How Money Is Created

   We have discussed why and how money, a representation of perceived
   value, is created in the economy, but another important factor
   concerning money and the economy is how a country's central bank (the
   central bank in the United States is the Federal Reserve or the Fed)
   can influence and manipulate the money supply.

   If the Fed wants to increase the amount of money in circulation,
   perhaps to boost economic activity, the central bank can, of course,
   print it. However, the physical bills are only a small part of the
   money supply.

   Another way for the central bank to increase the money supply is to buy
   government fixed-income securities in the market. When the central bank
   buys these government securities, it puts money into the marketplace,
   and effectively into the hands of the public. How does a central bank
   such as the Fed pay for this? As strange as it sounds, the central bank
   simply creates the money and transfers it to those selling the
   securities. Alternatively, the Fed can lower [175]interest rates
   allowing banks to extend low-cost loans or credit—a phenomenon known as
   cheap money—and encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow and
   spend.

   To shrink the money supply, perhaps to reduce inflation, the central
   bank does the opposite and sells government securities. The money with
   which the buyer pays the central bank is essentially taken out of
   circulation. Keep in mind that we are generalizing in this example to
   keep things simple.

   A central bank cannot print money without end. If too much money is
   issued, the value of that currency will drop consistent with the law of
   supply and demand.

   Remember, as long as people have faith in the currency, a central bank
   can issue more of it. But if the Fed issues too much money, the value
   will go down, as with anything that has a higher supply than demand.
   Therefore, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants.

The History of American Money

Currency Wars

   In the 17th century, Great Britain was determined to keep control of
   both the American colonies and the natural resources they controlled.
   To do this, the British limited the money supply and made it illegal
   for the colonies to mint coins of their own. Instead, the colonies were
   forced to trade using English bills of exchange that could only be
   redeemed for English goods. Colonists were paid for their goods with
   these same bills, effectively cutting them off from trading with other
   countries.

   In response, the colonies regressed to a barter system using
   ammunition, tobacco, nails, pelts, and anything else that could be
   traded. Colonists also gathered whatever foreign currencies they could,
   the most popular being the large, silver Spanish dollars. These were
   called pieces of eight because, when you had to make change, you pulled
   out your knife and hacked it into eight bits. From this, we have the
   expression "two bits," meaning a quarter of a dollar.

Massachusetts Money

   Massachusetts was the first colony to defy the mother country. In 1652,
   the state minted its own silver coins including the Oak Tree and Pine
   Tree shillings. The state circumvented the British law stating that
   only the monarch of the British empire could issue coins by dating all
   their coins in 1652, a period when there was no monarch. In 1690,
   Massachusetts also issued the first paper money calling it bills of
   credit.

   Tensions between America and Britain continued to mount until the
   Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. The colonial leaders declared
   independence and created a new currency called [176]Continentals to
   finance their side of the war. Unfortunately, each government printed
   as much money as it needed without backing it to any standard or asset,
   so the Continentals experienced rapid inflation and became worthless.
   This experience discouraged the American government from using paper
   money for almost a century.

Aftermath of the Revolution

   The chaos from the Revolutionary War left the new nation's monetary
   system a complete wreck. Most of the currencies in the newly formed
   United States of America were useless. The problem wasn't resolved
   until 13 years later in 1788 when Congress was granted constitutional
   powers to coin money and regulate its value. In 1792, the Coinage Act
   was passed establishing the first national mint which created a
   national monetary system and unit of money, the dollar. There was also
   a bimetallic standard, meaning that both silver and gold could be
   valued in and used to back paper dollars.

   It took years to get all the foreign coins as well as competing state
   and local bank currencies out of circulation. Banks issued their own
   notes during this time period, which was technically illegal as only
   Congress and the federal government had this power. Most of these banks
   issued more notes than they had coin to cover, as a result these notes
   often traded at less than face value.

   In the 1860s, the U.S. government created $450 million in legal tender
   to finance its battle against the Confederacy in the American Civil
   War. These were called [177]greenbacks because their backs were printed
   in green. The government-backed this currency and stated that it could
   be used to pay back both public and private debts. The value did,
   however, fluctuate according to the North's success or failure at
   certain stages in the war.

   Confederate dollars, issued by the seceding states during the 1860s,
   followed the fate of the Confederacy and were worthless by the end of
   the war.

Aftermath of the Civil War

   In February 1863, the U.S. Congress passed the National Bank Act. This
   act established a monetary system whereby national banks issued notes
   backed by U.S. government bonds. The U.S. Treasury then worked to get
   state bank notes out of circulation so that the national bank notes
   would become the only currency.

   During this period of rebuilding, there was debate over the bimetallic
   standard. Some advocated using just silver to back the dollar, others
   advocated for gold. The situation was resolved in 1900 when the
   [178]Gold Standard Act was passed, which made gold the sole backing for
   the dollar. This backing meant that, in theory, you could take your
   paper money and exchange it for the corresponding value in gold. In
   1913, the Federal Reserve was created and given the power to steer the
   economy by controlling the money supply and interest rates on loans.

The Bottom Line

   Money has changed substantially since the days of shells and skins, but
   its main function hasn't changed at all. Regardless of what form it
   takes, money offers us a medium of exchange for goods and services and
   allows the economy to grow as transactions can be completed at greater
   speeds.

   Hi, All
   I am writting to you hoping someone will be able to help me out.
   I am facing a very strange situation. I was waiting a payment by June
   20th (for a regular client I know well and who always pays me proprly),
   but as I wasn't getting any news from him, I tried to reach him from
   another mail ID, to see if he was still "alive".
   I got an answer quite fast, but when I explained who I really was, I
   got a mail informing I was not in contact with the proper client but
   his wife (she told me he had an accident and so she was taking things
   up, but she didn't answer about my payment requests as she was not
   directly concerned). What is preoccupatory too is that she said she had
   to invest all their money on his hospitalization!!!
   I tried to get some proofs of that but she answered she had other more
   important things to deal with.
   Since then, I can't get any news about my payment and no answer to my
   mails...
   I contacted other people who worked for the same client and they said
   they didn't get any news recently neither.
   I am quite desperate as this is a huge sum, and I don't know how to
   act....
   I tried to contact the French Ambassy in Pondichéry, but I got no help.
   My last hope is maybe to get in contact with a translator based in
   Pondichéry, who could "analyse" things closer ? As I am in France, I am
   quite helpless...
   Thank you in advance for your kind help.

   What a horrid problem
            Aug 12, 2017
   My sympathies, Cerise. It's difficult to know what you can do for the
   best. Finding someone local to the client would certainly be very
   useful. They could at least get some idea about whether she's lying.
   Maybe you can find a local lawyer who knows something? Or you could
   call in a debt recovery company in the area who would only charge if
   they recover your money. That's often the best way if a company
   currently has some money but might fail soon - 70% or so is better than
   nothing, after all.

   Update. I often use Wikipedia to find out how to discover the health of
   companies in other countries. It's led me to a site where they'll
   hopefully be listed if your client was running a properly registered
   company. I imagine with the details you have of the company (company
   name; director's name; company number etc) you'll be able to find them
   there and see if they're still solvent. This is the website:

   Good luck and do let us know what happens. ^ Collapse

   ... and award the agency in question with one (1) point only, together
   with a brief explanation, and wait for the reaction of your "partner".
   You can also opt asking proz.com for assistance, when you fill out the
   form (correct me, if I´m wrong). How many points does your India based
   agency already have?

   Don't believe a word of it. And it isn't their money. It's your money.
   Take a decision. The decision is: you are going to get paid.
   Then start working out how to do it. Coldly, methodically, and not
   feeling upset or resentful. It's just a job you have to do. Sheila and
   Mattias have already made a couple of suggestions.

   Recovering 2700 dollars
              Aug 13, 2017
   From experience I can tell you that agencies in some countries are best
   ignored.
   Geography plays a huge influence in my due diligence on prospective
   clients.
   You might get a cheap fight to Pondichery and visit them in person and
   complain to the local police department. This might embarrass them. But
   based on your conversation with the client, it is clear that they are
   not rational people.

   Don't give up. Do some research. I spent 5 minutes googling and came up
   with various possibilities.
   Bear in mind that India is one of the most internet and IT-savvy
   countries in the world, has a well developed space programme, and is
   one of the BRIC countries. So although you may have a picture in your
   mind of poverty, dirt, and a vast wealth gap in India, that is
   certainly not the situation of your non-paying client. Many people in
   India are extremely well-off.
   Here's one guy you might try contacting:

   Complaint to local Authorities
                     Aug 13, 2017
   Hi Cerise,
   I am from India and my suggestion would be to give complaint regarding
   this dubious dealing to local Authorities. You can even tell your
   client that you are going to file a complaint to Income Tax Department.
   If he or she refuses to budge then you can actually file a complaint.
   You can approach local Police also. I think first you should give them
   a warning mail.

   Thank you. Can you help me by giving me the adress to contact ? I am
   afraid they won't consider it if I send a simple mail...

   You should not Jump the gun
                  Aug 13, 2017
   I think you should first send them a warning mail. In this you can give
   them some time for Payment and tell them about the options you will
   take if your Payment is not done. I don't think writing to some private
   person, like the above will be of any help. You can only get help from
   Local Authorities.

   I agree about the warning email but don't tell them about the options.
   Just say, very politely, that unless you receive full payment into your
   bank account by (date) further action may follow without notice.
   After that DO NOT contact them again. Let them worry about what you
   might do.

   Hi.
   I don't say that you can go ahead. If you can find the solution, please
   go ahead. ED was discharged from Hospital recently and at Rehabs Center
   at the moment.
   Frankly speaking, he has tried a bad movement of suicide attempt last
   weekend due to financial crisis and physical & mentally inability
   feeling about him. I'm still being his back bone to get his steady mind
   as like earlier.
   Normally he is not a kind of person. He is very bold but I don't know
   what's going on in his mind since he feels insecure about the physical
   loss and financial problems.
   I hope that you can understand my state of mind at present. Everything
   much be resolved so...
   Thanks ^ Collapse

   Maybe her story is true?
               Aug 18, 2017
   What a difficult situation for you!
   It's just possible that the lady's story is true. I say this only
   because usually real scammers and cheats don't reply to payment
   reminders at all and simply disappear from view. From the message you
   quote, at least she seems to acknowledge that the money is owed to you.
   What response did you receive from the entities you contacted about the

   My only suggestion would be to find someone who lives in or near the
   city where your client is located and might be willing to make
   enquiries as to whether a Mr ED really suffered an accident recently,
   was hospitalised and is now in rehab. Perhaps another Prozian based in
   India could help?
   Otherwise, legal action as suggested by Tom in London and others seems
   your only solution.
   Courage, ma belle! ^ Collapse

   What response did you receive from the entities you contacted about the
   situation?
   They don't speak english so I couldn't have any communication.
   I reached the French Ambassady and got in contact who someone speaking
   french, who took note of the case and told me he would contact me if
   anything arises from such information...

White House says money for Ukraine military aid is running out with Congress
divided on whether to provide more

   CNN  —

   The White House made clear Friday that the amount of money the US has
   available for Ukraine military aid is quickly running out as House
   Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate remain at odds over the Biden
   administration’s multi-billion dollar request for more funding.

   A $425 million security package announced on Friday pushed the US to
   the limit on the money available to Kiev.

   “We are beginning to provide Ukraine with smaller [Presidential
   Drawdown Authority] packages in order to stretch out our ability to
   support Ukraine for as long as possible,” White House Press Secretary
   Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.

   Last month, President Joe Biden requested more than $100 billion for
   national security, including $61.4 billion for Ukraine and $14.3
   billion for Israel, urging Congress to pass the supplemental bill as a
   “comprehensive, bipartisan agreement.”

   The administration’s request includes $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine
   and $14.3 billion in aid for Israel, $9.15 billion in funding for
   humanitarian aid, $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the
   Indo-Pacific region and $13.6 billion to address security at the
   US-Mexico border.

   But the newly elected GOP speaker has yet to outline his plan for
   Ukraine funding after decoupling the request from Israel aid, which the
   House passed Thursday.

   “Ukraine will come in short order, it will come next,” Johnson said at
   a press conference Thursday, linking it to a need for stricter border
   security policies which will be far harder to pass in the
   Democratic-led Senate. “If we’re going to take care of a border in
   Ukraine, we need to take care of America’s border as well.”

   The most recent package included $125 million from a presidential
   drawdown, which is equipment and weaponry pulled directly from Defense
   Department stocks and quickly shipped to Ukraine. But it is one of the
   smallest drawdown packages given to Ukraine since the start of the war
   more than 18 months ago, as the White House acknowledged it needed to
   stretch what little funding it had left.

   The package also included $300 million under the Ukraine Security
   Assistance Initiative (USAI), which exhausted the funding for that
   authority. Under USAI, the government contracts with industry to
   provide equipment to Ukraine, intending it as a longer-term transfer of
   supplies to Kyiv.

   The Pentagon’s Chief Financial Officer, Michael McCord, warned in early
   October that USAI money had run out for the previous fiscal year,
   urging Congress to pass additional funding.  The $300 million was the
   only money available for USAI from the current Continuing Resolution
   funding the government.

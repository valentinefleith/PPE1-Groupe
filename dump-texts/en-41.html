   When you have foodstuff with less price and at the same time you save
   more money, how do we say that in English? In other words, imagine you
   have a grocery and you want to write that on this board:

   If you want customers, I would use "discount groceries" rather than
   "cheap food'.

   I think all the responses so far assume that all your groceries are
   cheaper, always. When only some items are cheaper, for a limited time
   period, they are said to be "on special", or "on sale". For examples,
   "Today's specials - fresh fruit, soap, garden supplies."
   PS: Is it possible to buy groceries at a lower price without saving
   money?

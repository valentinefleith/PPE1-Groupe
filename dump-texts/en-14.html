What is money?

   24 November 2015 (updated on 20 June 2017)

   Euro banknotes and coins are money but so is the balance on a bank
   account. What actually is money? How is it created and what is the
   ECB’s role?
   [36]Tell me: What is a central bank?

The changing essence of money

   The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually
   commodity money – an object made of something that had a market value,
   such as a gold coin. Later on, representative money consisted of
   banknotes that could be swapped against a certain amount of gold or
   silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat
   money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a
   central bank but, unlike representative money, cannot be converted
   into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. It has no intrinsic value –
   the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless – yet is still
   accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the
   central bank to keep the value of money stable over time. If central
   banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money would lose its general
   acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store
   of value.

The nature of money over time

   Present-day currency can also exist independently of a physical
   representation. Money can exist in a bank account in the form of a
   computer entry or stored in the form of a savings account. Digital
   cash, or e-money, is monetary value stored in a pre-paid card or
   smartphone, for example. And direct debits, internet payments and card
   transfers are all forms of payment that do not involve cash. (There are
   even newer decentralised digital currencies or [37]virtual currency
   schemes like Bitcoin that exist without a central point of control like
   a central bank. These are not regarded as money from a legal
   perspective.)

   Despite the rapid rise in electronic payments, cash is still very
   popular. In the euro area, cash is used for a high proportion of all
   payments under €20. The value of euro cash is guaranteed by the ECB and
   the national central banks of the euro area countries, which together
   form the Eurosystem.

The uses of money and how the ECB keeps track of it

   Money, whatever its form, has three different functions. It is a medium
   of exchange – a means of payment with a value that everyone trusts.
   Money is also a unit of account allowing goods and services to be
   priced. And it is a store of value. Only a portion of euro cash in
   circulation actually circulates, i.e. is used for processing payments.
   For example, many of the circulating €50 notes are hoarded.

The functions of money

   Central banks usually define and monitor several monetary aggregates.
   Developments in these aggregates can reveal useful information about
   money and prices. Several aggregates are needed because many different
   financial assets are substitutable and the nature and characteristics
   of financial assets, transactions and means of payment change over
   time. The Eurosystem has defined a narrow (M1), an “intermediate” (M2)
   and a broad monetary aggregate (M3) for use in the ECB’s monetary
   analysis. The ECB looks at developments in these aggregates, together
   with a lot of other information and analyses, as part of its monetary
   policy strategy.

How is money created?

   The ECB acts as a bank for the commercial banks and this is also how it
   influences the flow of money and credit in the economy to achieve
   stable prices. Commercial banks, in turn, can borrow money, i.e.
   central bank reserves, from the ECB, usually to cover very short-term
   liquidity needs. The ECB’s main tool for controlling the quantity of
   “outside” money, and hence the demand for central bank reserves by
   commercial banks, is setting very short-term interest rates – the “cost
   of money”.

Money creation in the euro area

   Commercial banks can also create so-called “inside” money, i.e. bank
   deposits – this happens every time they issue a new loan. The
   difference between outside and inside money is that the former is an
   asset for the economy as a whole, but it is nobody’s liability. Inside
   money, on the other hand, is named this way because it is backed by
   private credit: if all the claims held by banks on private debtors were
   to be settled, the inside money created would be reversed to zero. So,
   it is one form of currency that is created – and can be reversed –
   within the private economy.

What about the ECB’s “money-printing” scheme I keep reading about?

   In practice, only the national central banks physically issue euro
   banknotes. “Money-printing” is the colloquial term for the ECB’s asset
   purchase programme, a form of “quantitative easing”. By purchasing
   assets in the financial market, the ECB creates additional central bank
   reserves that can help reduce – through a variety of channels – the
   interest rates faced by households and firms with a view to supporting
   the economy and, ultimately, to keep the value of money stable when the
   room to cut those interest rates directly controlled by the ECB is
   limited. In this process, the ECB does not actually print banknotes to
   pay for the assets but creates money electronically, which is credited
   to the seller or intermediary, e.g. a commercial bank. The seller can
   then use the additional liquidity to buy other assets or, in case of a
   commercial bank, extend credit to the real economy. The purchases
   contribute to improving monetary and financial conditions, making it
   cheaper for businesses and households to borrow so they can invest and
   spend more. The ultimate aim is that inflation rates return to levels
   close to but below 2% in line with the ECB’s price stability mandate.

   Leaving Canada Pension Plan could save Albertans billions, says study |
   Reuters
   Although I know this is mostly a political ploy reminiscent of what
   would happen to Canada/the provinces if Quebec pursued sovereignty.
   However the news of the report on how much Alberta should/would receive
   piqued my interest. Perhaps because I had a lot of involvement with
   Lifeworks (formerly Morneau Scheppel) as a H&W benefit trustee. I
   haven't been able to locate the report but it does get me thinking.
   How would this all work?
   Who would be entitled to the new plan?
   How would the payout restructuring work? etc
   I know a lot of this would have to be sorted out by lawyers and
   actuaries. However, if Brexit is possible perhaps deconstructing a
   national pension system is also doable. Has Western alienation taken a
   deep enough hold to make this a possibility. I don't believe so but I
   don't really know how any of it would work. If someone is able to get
   the report I would love to give it a read.
   My apologies if there is already a discussion started in the non money
   topic threads.

   From what was reported, the report is full off errors, miscalculations,
   and self serving assumptions.
   They claim 53% of the CPP fund based on their conclusions.
   The CPP pegs the actual number contributed by Albertans at 16% of the
   fund including the investment gains.
   If Ontario did the same calculation and left the fund before Alberta
   there wouldn't be enough left in the fund to pay Alberta in full or
   anyone else.
   If both Alberta and Ontario left there wouldn't be anything left to pay
   the other Provinces.
   Obviously that isn't going to happen.
   I don't think it is going anywhere because the vast majority of
   Albertans are opposed to it.

   Shiver me timbers lads.....be it smooth sailing or stormy seas ahead.

   ... your last sentence - all dang, I was hoping that majority would say
   'YES' and support their quack premier. In fact, I would wholeheartedly
   SUPPORT their quack premier's on this - Alberta's pull-out (not
   dismantling) from the national's CPP.
   They can even opt-out immediately and get the EFF out from the rest of
   Canada just as Quebec had wished to. And while they're at that - take
   their EFF quack premier with them. Like the rest of Canada are gonna to
   miss them quacks, including those EFFING FreeDumbers, wasting everyone
   else's money and time.
   And no, their contributions weren't more than half, far less than that
   as they're only 1 province of 10 for Canada with a population that's
   far far less than the eastern ones. Simple math.

   Didn't Alberta's own fund (AIMCo) punch a massive hole in their fund by
   stupidly gambling on volatility derivatives? They lost $4 billion on
   that ridiculous investment.
   Hope they make better choices with their investments if they step away
   from CPP

   A reminder of how Alberta manages their pension money:
   www.canadianmoneyforum.com

Alberta loses billions in faulty strategy

   This Bloomberg article tipped me off. Has anyone else heard about this?
   Apparently, AIMCo (the Alberta Investment Management Corp., which
   invests Alberta public pensions) lost billions of $ on faulty
   volatility strategies during the recent market crash...

   Here's the link to the actual report. Alberta pension plan : analysis
   of costs, benefits, risks and considerations - Open Government
   Looks like it was a waste of money, given that its methodology was
   flawed. On the surface it seems to make sense, the asset calculation
   would be contribution with investment returns minus what has been paid
   out. The problem is how they calculate what was paid out. They base it
   only on the people collecting CPP in Alberta, which completely
   overlooks the fact that people would work in Alberta to contribute, but
   then retire outside the province and collect CPP. The problem is that
   they don't include those out-of-province retirees. In fact, they
   actually state that as one of the deficiencies in the study on page 14:
   (iii) Similarly, we believe that the benefit payments attributed to
   Alberta in the publicly available information are based on CPP payments
   made to Alberta residents. Additional refinements may be needed for an
   actual final calculation to reflect the payments to individuals who
   migrated to or from Alberta following retirement or who had a period of
   employment in Alberta.
   And it's pretty obvious that's how they calculated it when you look at
   Annex B: Table B.1.a – Historical Base CPP and Alberta contributions,
   benefits, operating expenses and rates of return ($million except where
   noted).
   All this does is reinforce the fact that people advocating for the APP
   still forget the fact that the CPP belongs to the individual and not
   the province where contributions occurred.

   Thank you for the report and highlighting its key flaws. I am 99%
   certain this initiative won't happen but wanted to explore the concept
   further more from a hypothetical perspective. Not for a moment did I
   believe some of the numbers being put out in our mainstream media. Even
   this link Your pension, your choice | alberta.ca which has some
   interesting information makes some crazy assumptions.
   "Alberta’s government would work with partners at the CPP to develop
   agreements that would allow individuals to move throughout Canada
   without disrupting or decreasing benefits."
   Can Canadians move throughout the country without changing their
   benefits now? Of course they can. 🤦‍♂️
   What I did find interesting in the report was the provisions in place
   for a province to opt out of the plan. And as I imagined implementation
   would be both costly and cumbersome.
   I struggled with the claims that Albertans pay considerably more than
   their share into the plan than they receive and found this report from
   the Fraser institute from 2019.
   Albertans Make Disproportionate Contributions to National Programs: The
   Canada Pension Plan as a Case Study (fraserinstitute.org)
   TLDR - AB has a higher employment rate. Alberta has a higher income
   rate. Therefore AB contributes more per capita than other provinces.
   Another item of interest to me in the Fraser report is the
   interprovincial migration data for those 65 had a slight overlap to the
   years the CPP made a small net payment to retirees. Not sure there is
   any significance in the observation but these peculiarities always
   catch my attention.
   Rectangle Slope Plot Font Parallel
   Azure Rectangle Slope Font Line
   I do think the changes made to the CPP have addressed some of the
   concerns put forward in the Fraser report regarding potential
   shortfalls.

   The Premier is between a rock and a hard place. She does not control
   her UCP Party. It and she are controlled by a group by the name of Take
   Back Alberta. They are pulling the strings. Anti science, populist, far
   right, politics and religion combo group. As a result her Party has
   seem many of the old hands, the pros leave the party. Similar in many
   instance to what has happened to the CPC over the past number of years.
   My spouses crazy hillbilly cousins think she is bees knees. That alone
   speaks volumes to me!
   Don't forget.... our Premier is a person who for weeks touted
   hydroxychloroquine as a cure for covid on her open line radio show.
   That is after everyone else walked away from it given the scientific
   evidence to the contrary. She got bounced off the radio station. They
   apparently could not deal with her nonsense any longer.
   If that is not enough, she has so little insight into our justice
   system that for weeks she was suggesting publicly, multiple times, that
   as Premier she would have the ability to 'pardon' people who were
   convicted of covid related and border blocking offences in court and
   found guilty. And she would do so.
   She is an embarrassment to Albertans. The depth of her ignorance in how
   Government works and our justice system in Canada has no limits.

   CPP benefits are determined by level of and duration of contributions.
   If Alberta workers are earn more and work longer they will receive
   higher benefits than those who don't.......regardless of where they
   live and work.
   The benefit is based on the individual contributions, which people can
   view at the Service Canada website.
   As already noted.......the CPP belongs solely and entirely to
   individual workers and no government has any right to claim any part of
   it.
   The CPP also has disability pensions, survivor pensions, and a small
   $2500 death benefit mixed into the calculations.
   The only way to windup the CPP fund equitably would be to freeze all
   contributions from Albertans and pay out the benefits when they are due
   to be paid.
   Alberta could start their own pension fund but would have to do it with
   their own money like the Saskatchewan Pension Plan has already done.

   AIMCO did lose a bunch of cash and they were using pooled pension money
   from the pensions they govern. It is my understanding that LAPP was
   skeptical of the AIMCO investment as it relates to the loss in the
   above discussion and insured the investment and cut the LAPP portion of
   the loss by +/- 20%. I'd have to read to get the true numbers but LAPP
   saved their own *** on that one.

   Large pension funds hold diverse assets and yes sometimes some of their
   investments take a hit. This happens. The CPP doesn't have a secret
   magical formula for managing pension funds. Didn't the Ontario
   Teacher's pension fund take a hit based on in a crypto currency
   investment that went broke. Seems illogical to assume the only people
   who can successfully manage a pension fund must be appointed and
   anointed by Ottawa.

   ... sounds like she immigrated from the camp of MToiletG, LB the little

   If she wants to stay and work in Canada, I can make a recommendation
   for her with one of my ex-bosses too. But she'll have to move to
   Pickering, Ontario though.

   It is amazing just how ignorant some people are. When Tamara Lich's
   husband went before an Ottawa magistrate during the freedom march he
   tried to claim as a defence that he was only 'protecting' his First
   Amendment rights. He really did not have a clue. The magistrate was
   less than impressed.

   We have friends who worked in Fort McMurray for 20 years flying back
   and forth to Ontario and then returned permanently when he found a good
   job in Ontario.
   Our son worked in Alberta for a year and paid into CPP, so some of his
   benefit would have to be paid by Alberta.
   They base the calculations on a young work force, but if they divided
   up the CPP fund the same as a commuted value of a pension, wouldn't
   young people get smaller amounts due to the length of time for the
   invested capital to grow until retirement ?

   Smith will hold a referendum.
   She is counting on support from the far right hillbillies in rural
   Alberta.
   A common refrain is 'I do not trust Trudeau with my pension money'
   That is the level of ignorance that Smith is counting on to win the
   referendum. They have no idea and are not interested in knowing. If it
   is on facebook it must be true.

   QPP does allow the same, so that's what they are basing that statement
   as. However, it's worth noting that CPP and QPP essentially have the
   same benefits the only thing that determines what you get is where you
   first retire assuming you worked both under CPP and QPP. But, what's
   also worth noting is that the QPP premiums (6.40%) are higher than CPP
   (5.95%). Difference could be attributed to the demographics changes
   (Quebec aging out more). Generally, if the demographics are younger,
   sure you can have lower premiums, but they aren't going to be that
   dramatic unless you do what the study does and what APP proponents
   overlook, which is excluding those who retire away from Alberta.
   I think you may wanted to include this graph:
   Rectangle Slope Font Plot Line
   It doesn't tell the whole tale of course. I mean part of the narrative
   is that Alberta oilpatch is high paying, itinerant population, so maybe
   most leave before reaching age of 65 if they don't intend to settle.
   And of course, like everywhere else in Canada, Alberta is aging... not
   as high a percentage as other provinces, but if this isn't taken into
   account and they are just using current numbers, you're going to hit a
   shortfall real soon if they actually go and decrease contribution rates
   like the report says it could.

   The political line is that Alberta has massively over-contributed but
   it seems that the reality is simply that many Canadians have chosen to
   work in Alberta and then retire elsewhere.

   That has always been the way I interpreted the situation. I always got
   the impression people made their money in Alberta, and then returned
   back to where they came from. And then there are those who would retire
   in BC for the weather. But then again, there are those who stay in
   Alberta their whole lives. I don't know if people have actually done a
   detailed study of migration sliced by age groups. I suspect the data is
   out there.

   Maybe he was from Manitoba and afraid that the government would strip
   Canadian citizenship by unmaking Manitoba a province?
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada
   Or maybe the post-1982 amendment to strengthen Aboriginal rights in the
   Constitution, so he was an activist working for indigenous rights all
   the time?
   Nah, that would actually give him some credit for knowing some more
   obscure Canadian Constitutional amendments over the US ones we hear all
   the time.

   Same playbook as Brexit. The Brexit supporters were essentially saying
   that the UK could keep all the benefits of EU membership and none of
   the drawbacks, but they've quickly found out that's not the case.

   zinfit said:

   nonsense. There is absolutely no reason that Alberta could create a
   professionally managed fund on par with CPP. Some of Canada's most
   respected asset managers are Albertans. If all else they could simply
   duplicate he CPP asset mix.
   Click to expand...

   2020 returns: CPP 12.1%, AIMCO 2.5%
   2021 returns: CPP 20.4%, AIMCO 14.7%
   2022 returns: CPP 1.3%, AIMCO -3.4%
   It's not even close for performance, and I'd be skeptical that somehow
   AIMCO's performance suddenly shoots up with additional funds. If you
   want to argue that Alberta has the right people in place to perform as
   well as CPP, maybe they should be working for AIMCO because differences
   of 5% to 10% for returns are pretty significant. It's also not so
   simple as duplicating CPP asset mix when you include lag, and the fact
   that they've invested in private equity firms. Another example is the
   fact that it owns 50.01% of the 407 ETR which is something AIMCO
   couldn't duplicate.

   QPP does allow the same, so that's what they are basing that statement
   as. However, it's worth noting that CPP and QPP essentially have the
   same benefits the only thing that determines what you get is where you
   first retire assuming you worked both under CPP and QPP. But, what's
   also worth noting is that the QPP premiums (6.40%) are higher than CPP
   (5.95%). Difference could be attributed to the demographics changes
   (Quebec aging out more). Generally, if the demographics are younger,
   sure you can have lower premiums, but they aren't going to be that
   dramatic unless you do what the study does and what APP proponents
   overlook, which is excluding those who retire away from Alberta.
   I think you may wanted to include this graph:

   It doesn't tell the whole tale of course. I mean part of the narrative
   is that Alberta oilpatch is high paying, itinerant population, so maybe
   most leave before reaching age of 65 if they don't intend to settle.
   And of course, like everywhere else in Canada, Alberta is aging... not
   as high a percentage as other provinces, but if this isn't taken into
   account and they are just using current numbers, you're going to hit a
   shortfall real soon if they actually go and decrease contribution rates
   like the report says it could.
   That has always been the way I interpreted the situation. I always got
   the impression people made their money in Alberta, and then returned
   back to where they came from. And then there are those who would retire
   in BC for the weather. But then again, there are those who stay in
   Alberta their whole lives. I don't know if people have actually done a
   detailed study of migration sliced by age groups. I suspect the data is
   out there.
   Maybe he was from Manitoba and afraid that the government would strip
   Canadian citizenship by unmaking Manitoba a province?
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada
   Or maybe the post-1982 amendment to strengthen Aboriginal rights in the
   Constitution, so he was an activist working for indigenous rights all
   the time?
   Nah, that would actually give him some credit for knowing some more
   obscure Canadian Constitutional amendments over the US ones we hear all
   the time.
   Same playbook as Brexit. The Brexit supporters were essentially saying
   that the UK could keep all the benefits of EU membership and none of
   the drawbacks, but they've quickly found out that's not the case.
   2020 returns: CPP 12.1%, AIMCO 2.5%
   2021 returns: CPP 20.4%, AIMCO 14.7%
   2022 returns: CPP 1.3%, AIMCO -3.4%
   It's not even close for performance, and I'd be skeptical that somehow
   AIMCO's performance suddenly shoots up with additional funds. If you
   want to argue that Alberta has the right people in place to perform as
   well as CPP, maybe they should be working for AIMCO because differences
   of 5% to 10% for returns are pretty significant. It's also not so
   simple as duplicating CPP asset mix when you include lag, and the fact
   that they've invested in private equity firms. Another example is the
   fact that it owns 50.01% of the 407 ETR which is something AIMCO
   couldn't duplicate.

   I could care less if pension plan managers, asset managers are/were
   Albertans by birth or by choice.
   I only care about RESULTS. I do not care when they were born, where
   they live. When I look various Y/E bottom line numbers on financials I
   have yet to see one that includes the heritage of the executive members
   or investment advisory board. Have you?

   One benefit for an expanded AIMCO.
   It would provide many high paying jobs for UCP and for Take Back
   Alberta hacks.
   I cannot think of any others.

   The CPP plan currently includes 4 chronic have not provinces . If
   Alberta left the CPP it eliminates that risk.

   Have not provinces are absolutely meaningless in the numbers.
   CPP is a pension fund paid by employers and employees. It it the sum of
   those workers/contributors. Lots of people who pay into CPP in 'have
   not' provinces. Current and past. As in Quebec, Ontario, and others
   from time to time.
   CPP has zero to do with the economic status for province vis a vis
   equalization payments.
   Have not is nothing but a red herring argument.
   There is no risk. CPP pension amounts are based solely on the CPP
   formulas.

   I will take a professionally managed pension plan over one managed,
   influenced by political appointees, politicians, and friends any day of
   the week.
   Bottom line...if ANY Alberta Gov't was serious about AIM they would
   have made it completely independent in the manner of the CPP.
   Really...how would anyone be comfortable with the relevant skills of
   any appointee Danielle Smith appointee???

   ... I don't know why but whenever her name comes up, I see if not hear
   a quack job.
   Are there no "pension specialists", specifically CPP actuaries employed
   in Alberta?

   not irrelevant when these weak sisters keep taking more then they put
   in and secondly they haven't got positive demographics. With the
   current equalization program they have little incentive to change.

   So, do you even understand how the CPP works? Because you don't seem to
   understand the concept of a pension plan.
   Start here: Canada Pension Plan - Overview - Canada.ca
   TLDR, what you get out of the CPP is scaled to what you paid. So those
   making less will contribute less and collect less, which also means a
   lower pension liability.
   BTW you'll notice that the report completely ignores the liability
   component of the pension plan because that part isn't as favourable, or
   at least doesn't play well in the news that if Alberta wants 50% of the
   assets, it's taking 50% of the unfunded liabilities which is about
   $600B. I have a feeling when they said they could drop contribution
   rates, they kind of left the unfunded liabilities out of the
   calculation.
   Edit: BTW, in case you've forgotten, the "weak sisters" are
   historically the source of the Alberta oil fields workforce. You know,
   the workers doing the hard work and paying CPP while in Alberta, but
   then when they get too old, go back to their province of origin and
   then collect what they rightfully contributed.

   Why do I get the impression that this scheme is just about creating
   patronage positions for political lackeys and a slush fund for pet
   projects.

   It will be bait and switch using two washed up political hacks neither
   of whom could ever be considered a pension expert. Big numbers at the
   front end that, when negotiated, will fizzle to small numbers in the
   final version. Preston Manning will be an expert on anything.....his
   interest is in the consultancy fee and getting his name in the media.
   This is all about keeping the power behind the throne, Take Back
   Alberta, happy and maintaining Smith's one and only one political
   strategy of Ottawa bashing to switch the channel away from Government
   performance and accountability.

   Interesting that PP has been silent on this. Most conservative voters
   value Canada and are only slightly right of center. If he hopes to form
   a Canadian government he would be well advised to take a stand for
   Canada on debates like this.

   Agree
   It is a very politically dangerous discussion for him to enter. Our
   elections are generally decided by 116 urban ridings in Montreal, GTA,
   and and Vancouver. The CPC has lost three consecutive elections because
   they failed miserably to appeal to these voters in sufficient numbers.
   Only 8 of those 116 ridings are currently held by the CPC.
   How do you suppose voters in those Ontario and BC ridings will feel
   about Alberta's proposal/ numbers???
   IF he is smart he will oppose Alberta on this. At some point he will
   have to make a decision. The earlier the better for him IMHO.
   He will get all of the Alberta seats no matter what he does so why on
   earth would he risk loosing any of those 'tight' urban ridings. There
   is no political cheese for him in supporting the Alberta position.
   Nor will it look good if he waffles and sits on the fence. Or if he
   turns his discussion point from yes or no to a debate on how much of
   the CPP pot Alberta is entitled to.

   It is common for Saskatchewan to copycat Alberta policy. Sask wants to
   be Alberta 2.0 just as much as Alberta wants to be Texas, Canada. Makes
   sense to me as many Albertans have ties/roots in Sask.

   I am a SK transplant. Every third person in my Alberta community seems
   to have a strong SK connection. Haultain the Governor before these
   provinces were admitted as provinces was totally opposed to splitting
   the territory into two provinces. He felt the split was a divide and
   control strategy.

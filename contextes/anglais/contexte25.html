#[1]Money magazine - Comments - What the bank looks at when you ask to borrow money IFRAME: [2]https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-TPGS5WC -- [33]BANKING What the bank looks at when you ask to borrow money [34] -- Most of us will apply for a loan at some stage in our lives, and if all goes to plan, your application will be approved - giving you the money you need, when you need it. -- In general, the property you're buying with a mortgage is used to secure the loan - if you are unable to repay the debt, the lender can sell the property to recoup their money. But the lender might not accept the property as security if it's too -- security supported by property owned by the family member. This security can allow you to borrow a larger amount of money, however, the guarantors asset is also at risk and could then be used to repay the debt if ever you were to default and your own security -- savings and spending habits. How does your cash flow look? Lenders will need to check that you have the ability to manage a debt, even if you already have money for a deposit.

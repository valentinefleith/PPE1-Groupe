Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't spend lots of money. Yet I have a decent income which should allow me to spend more and contribute more to the economy. Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy? Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing to the economy, isn't it? -- #3 · Oct 2, 2023 So if the economy is driven by people exchanging services with the help of money for transactions (basically, you work to earn money to use that money to buy someone else's work), then all of this system of stocks (capital) and bonds (debt) are unnecessary tools created for the sole purpose of making money from money and manipulating the economy using the interest rate of debt. Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual work. As opposed to contributing to the economy by working for money as a means of transaction to be spent elsewhere. Which is exactly what is stimulating the economy. -- Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual work.

But, I'd say that trading existing stocks back and forth between investors don't really contribute to that cycle, as the money doesn't go into the company for any sort of investment. However, one can make the argument that those who cash out will end up spending that money elsewhere which helps the economy. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py Like -- stimulating the economy 2. vs The understanding that investing sold be helping the economy because it needs lenders (bond buyers) and capital (stock buyers), yet we say that when people save more money and spend less, it's... bad for the economy And that's why I end up concluding that the real source of contribution -- Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the pace of economic growth would slow down, unless we decide to redirect that money from a consumption economy to a social economy where extra money is spent/invested into education, healthcare, shelter, all the essential needs. Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of the tools (capital & debt), because we need an equilibrium between the lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough borrowers (those who spend). Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

You will see coverage of new equity and bond financing that's happening, like big issuances of shares, how those shares were received, etc. BONDS - When you buy bonds, you are lending money to a variety of borrowers. For example an aggregate bond fund will hold a variety of debts, including corporate debt and securitized debts. So buying bonds will both lend money to corporations (allowing them to function) and even buys pools of securitized consumer debts, all kinds of things like credit card debts, auto loans, etc. BANK DEPOSITS - Even cash / savings deposits help by providing a -- Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of my frugal lifestyle.

If people invest or save the money there is no bump to the economy and it is referred to by central bankers as "dead money". If everyone was frugal to the extreme there would be fewer companies and employees and the economy would shrink and enter a recession. Our economy is a "consumer spending" economy depending on a balance of -- Businesses depend on mass consumer spending and expand production and services (jobs) when consumer demand warrants it. I have yet to hear a company say they are expanding production because rich people have more money invested in stock markets.

When the government gives people money, it causes an temporary bump, which gets paid back later when they pay off the debt. or they make it systemic, and it pushes up inflation. The thing is that money should represent work, or value, and if they just put out more, it's call inflation, but really what they mean is they're discounting the value of the work you did. Your 1.5hrs of min wage work for $10hr a decade ago is only worth 1 -- It's been a long time since I took economics, but essentially it's the mulitiplier effect (I cannot remember the exact term). Types of spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers, etc) within that system. Government spending also has another multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item with but the multiplier is now lower.

Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank where it doesn't circulate in the economy. Rather than looking at the safety of the banks or GICs, people would be encouraged to find other sources of return. Unfortunately, in Canada, we've been encouraged with the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of looking into investing in companies. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py Like -- Unfortunately, in Canada, we've been encouraged with the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now we're getting into the housing bubble.

And all that money into real estate is very unproductive. It's a terrible misallocation of capital IMO. I suspect that we will be paying the consequences for several decades. -- #30 · Oct 3, 2023 If you feel bad about being frugal, long time when I started to save and invest, I used to think: if billionares don't spend all their money, why should I spend all my money? Save Share Reply Quote -- Because billionaires are rich, and rich people are evil, so you shouldn't do rich people things that make people rich. It's much better to be poor and "moral". I think it's actually a good think to invest your money and create jobs, products and services that people want. Save Share -- If people saved and invested more heavily, how much would governments be able to reduce spending on disability, welfare, daycare, and other social programs, most importantly, healthcare? Every person the government can support less is less money spent by the government. You don't think that would have a huge impact on government budgets?

Decades of wages falling behind prices has made it continually more difficult for people to save or invest. -- Maybe big things, maybe small things, but they were spending too much. I like nice things, but I also say no to a lot, because I know I can't really afford it. Like I have the money, and I won't miss bills if I buy it, but if I buy that, I won't be able to keep building my savings, which is a more important goal. Too many people look at what they have left and spend it. -- Click to expand... It's true. I think people in this country do in fact earn enough, but they choose to spend a lot of money on luxuries. The iPhones are a good example; high-end smartphones are incredibly expensive. This is a completely unnecessary cost, pure luxury spending. I've been using the same $160 smartphone for 3 years now. -- building with food and restaurant orders. This is an extremely expensive way to get your food! So I agree with MrMatt that most people with steady jobs, and certainly middle-class people, actually have enough to save money into TFSAs. It's really a question about priorities and whether you want to spend your money immediately, or save for the future. But look around Canada and you'll see where people choose to put their money instead: expensive, never-ending home renovations, monstrously large houses with luxury furnishings, luxury smartphones, and shiny new cars. Everyone wants to live like they're a multi millionaire. Some people -- I try to be cautious because I remember my 20s which were very different than my 30s.

It's very important for a young adult to struggle a bit and learn how to manage their money. In my university years, I was living on 20K and searching around town for discounted groceries. I also had a used car and did my own maintenance. I am really thankful that I had to struggle and learn about money. When I was in my 20s, I even found some great furniture at second hand / thrift stores.

Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of the tools (capital & debt), because we need an equilibrium between the lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough borrowers (those who spend). Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

Types of spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers, etc) within that system. Government spending also has another multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item with but the multiplier is now lower. -- [187]MrBlackhill said: Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments...

Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank where it doesn't circulate in the economy.

   optimising or at least improving.
   I think it would be possibly interesting and fulfilling to help other
   people sort out their finances.
   I like being paid for my time, but this would be a pocket money type
   idea. But I'm wondering if it's more trouble than it's worth - would I
   need some level of financial accreditation? How would it work cross
   border (I live in France, I would want to deal with mostly British or

   see these things on your budget, can you replace with x, y, or z; you
   should open and use this kind of account; and so on.
   I'm wondering - is this worth the hassle? More trouble than it's worth?
   I guess the liability thing kicks in when money is exchanged, and
   that's mostly what I'm concerned about (this is not the USA; I'm
   unlikely to be sued, but still, I don't want to take the risk for 50
   Euros for a couple of hours or more of work!!).

   IÂm actually in the process of making a career change into financial
   planning, but am seriously considering starting a financial coaching
   business to start out and gain some hands-on, client-facing practical
   experience helping people as well as generating some money.  When I was
   an NCO in the Air Force, I did this for several of our new Airmen who
   came in; kids who often were still teenagers, just got married to their
   high-school sweetheart and had no clue why renterÂs insurance was

   I believe a few people here do this. There is also always blogging and
   I don't know if it is still profitable, but some people have made money
   on those short ebooks on Amazon. If the market is not too saturated and
   you have a niche, perhaps you could a series of financial ebooks.

   A 22-year-old starting their first job isn't going to pay $500 to have
   someone teach them why it's important to save for retirement and not go
   spend their paycheck on a new car, etc.
   Most financial planners make their money by managing assets and taking
   a percentage fee. Find a few hundred people that have collective assets
   of millions of dollars and extract a small percentage of that asset
   base every year. Or as a fee-only advisor you're charging a few

   of whom were around 18-25 and did not have a lot of financial literacy.
   I tried to address that and had certified financial planners come and
   give classes but most of it didn't stick. We were deploying and many of
   them would be making a lot more money and have lots of tax advantages
   like a savings account that paid 10% interest (a few years ago when a
   high-yield savings account paid 2% at best). I could barely get any of
   my Soldiers to participate in that - or contribute tax-free pay to a
   Roth IRA. Even the basics of just putting in enough money to their 401k
   to get the free 5% match was a challenge. I drove a car that cost $3k
   and was making more money than almost any of them. But they would come
   to drill in trucks that cost $40k+ while working a job making less than
   that per year.
   You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

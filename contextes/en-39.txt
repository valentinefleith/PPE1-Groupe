   specialized translation jobs?
   No need to specify your rates, of course, just give me a percentage.
   I'm thinking about specializing in these fields and even trying to
   become an "authorized" translator in my country, but only for money
   issues since I'm not actually that interested in law. Authorization
   requires both legal and financial specialization, so I need to figure
   out if it's worth all the studying.

   A contract is a contract is a contract, after all. Are they really that

   badly paid compared to other forms of translation (at least in

   for this client, the PM even pays me more than the (already high) rate
   I have entered in the database because neither she nor her client
   apparently care about money. I don't ask her to do this, she just
   automatically always gives me the most that she is able to. I am
   guessing she does this because the client is so important for them that
   it's more important that I am happy so that I do a very careful and

   you may spend more hours than you had anticipated but no matter how
   difficult the document is, you are keen to figure it out and do your

   I charge about 25% more per word for legal work than for general topics
   and my clients are fine with that. As David pointed out, this type of

   never) do anything just for the money. You need to be interested and
   passionate about what you do and enjoy it. Why not specialize in sports
   if you are interested in it and getting work, and do some subtitling on
   the side? Who knows what may come your way?

   for higher pay? Or was it because you saw a demand for it? Do you think
   that you would be equally well off (financially) translating, say,
   tourist information?
   I didn't choose economics for the money, but it has turned out quite
   lucrative, which is nice.
   I think you can command good rates in any field at all if (a) you're
   very good at it, and (b) you can find sufficiently discerning and

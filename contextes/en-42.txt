[XBTF]Questions about making money

   buy the ORE, even if I put low price to the stuff.
   Any way I can make a ship transport energy cells there? A cheap way,
   because I dont think I can afford to buy a ship. I have serious
   problems making money here, takes me lot of runs thru many stations,
   buying and selling to do few thousands, I dont think I can buy
   expensive staff such as mineral scanner or trading system extension,
   since I barelly have money for myself.
   Any early game making money tips?

   As long as you have money to buy energy cells, you can buy or use a
   current ship to buy for your station.
   The ship or fighter needs Trade 1 and 2 installed and supply software.
   Goto ships command menu.

   transport ships. However, I'm pretty sure those ships are limited to
   only buying resources the station needs, it's not possible to set them
   to automatically sell its products.
   However, you can pretty much always make money on stations in BTF
   because of the way the pricing structure is laid out--even if you set
   your ore to sell at the lowest possible price (to undercut the
   competition), you can still make a profit.

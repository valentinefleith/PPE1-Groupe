Abstract This paper develops a model where money is demanded in excess of spending needs. As a result, money coexists with large availabilities of credit and the model explains the levels of monetary aggregates held in modern economies via the endogenous creation of inside money. At the heart of the model, there is a search friction in the goods market, which generates spare production and spending capacity. As a consequence, there is an endogenous productivity wedge, due to spare production capacity, and an endogenous money velocity, due to spare spending capacity. -- of exchange.” Jevons ([34]1875) An unresolved question in monetary theory is why money coexists with the amount of credit and financial sophistication observed in modern societies. This is a problem because, in monetary theories where a role of money is not assumed ad hoc, credit crowds money out rather quickly. However, advancements in information technology are such that a range of financial arrangements that require information and commitment, such -- notable contributions demonstrated that it is possible to explain some coexistence, monetary equilibrium remains fragile to credit: Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([35]2016) (GMW) find that the value of money and credit taken together cannot exceed that of transactions in a monetary equilibrium, so when there is enough credit to finance all equilibrium transactions, money has no value. This paper develops a model where credit can be larger than transactions and yet money has value. A second contribution is to show that the information and commitment frictions necessary to give money a role can be weak enough to allow for futures contracts through which it is possible to have equilibrium with full insurance. As a consequence of money coexisting with large availabilities of credit, the paper explains the apparently puzzling evidence that, as modern economies go increasingly cashless, more money is held by the private sector. To get a sense of the magnitudes, an aggregate measure of monetary holdings, such as M1, was 2.63 times larger than quarterly -- primary goal of monetary theory. But how to explain these figures? Credit is important here because it expands the monetary base into broader money supply. Therefore, broad money expands as credit becomes more available. However, the credit needed to match the aforementioned monetary aggregates is too large for monetary equilibrium in the existing microfounded models where money demand is not assumed ad hoc, but emerges endogenously as a consequence of deep frictions. This paper develops a model where agents demand liquidity in excess of their spending per capita. As a result, money is valued even when the money stock, or credit availabilities, are in excess of transactions per capita and it becomes possible to match the abovementioned -- spending opportunities are hard to find and it is optimal not to spend all available funds. Money demand emerges as a need to store these unspent funds: the difficulty to spend generates “left over money,” or money as a residual store of value to carry unspent wealth into the future. The paper shows that with this motive, money is demanded even when it is dominated as a transaction means. -- that set-up, the search problem that spending opportunities are hard to find is resolved through an ex post Walrasian market where agents are free to adjust their composition of money and goods. As a result, money is demanded in the Walrasian market for its transaction value in the next period. This paper does not include a frictionless goods market. This absence generates an additional motive to hold money, thanks to which money is demanded even when it is dominated as a transaction means. To demonstrate this, I add a capital good that gives higher return than money and that can be turned into consumption at any time. With such a capital good, money would not be demanded in LW: an agent would leave the Walrasian market with capital and with no money because capital guarantees more consumption in the next period. However, the paper shows that without the Walrasian market, money is held not just for transaction purposes, but also as a consequence of the difficulty to turn liquid assets into goods: the lack of a centralized market makes capital hard to find. As a result, agents demand money to store value even if they prefer capital. So money is held not because it is easier to spend than capital (i.e., for transaction purposes), but because it is easier to acquire. Notice that this does not mean that money cannot then be used for transactions: if this was so, then money would not have value. But the transaction motive alone would not be sufficient to demand money because, as mentioned, agents prefer capital. To paraphrase, money is not demanded in order to make transactions easily, but rather because one does not make transactions easily.[38]1 Relating money and assets, the mechanism offers a resolution to the esteemed rate of return dominance puzzle voiced by Hicks: why money and more remunerative assets coexist? Because money is easier to find (and not because it is easier to spend). As a result, the transaction motive can be minimal, and yet money demand is large and very robust to credit. In particular, the value of money and credit can be larger than income. This way it is possible to match the magnitudes of aggregate monetary holdings. A general equilibrium perspective helps understand why money demand is larger than income: aggregate income equals aggregate spending, but since unmatched agents are not spending their income, matched agents must spend more than their income. And because agents do not know whether they are going to be in a match, everyone wants access to spending power (money + credit) in excess of their income. As a result, even if individual credit is equal to income, money demand is still positive.[39]2 This mechanism is also akin to the Baumol–Tobin (BT) model where an ad -- a liquid asset and goods: recent examples include Alvarez and Lippi ([40]2009), Kaplan and Violante ([41]2014), and Ragot ([42]2014) who emphasize the role of money as a store asset in BT models. One can think of the search friction in this paper as a microfoundation of a resembling portfolio friction. From this perspective, a motivation for -- presence of information frictions and to the ability of the private sector to issue liabilities that play a role as a medium of exchange. As a result, the model speaks to the issue of coexistence of money and financial sophistication.[43]3 -- Kehoe and Levine ([45]1993) and Alvarez and Jermann ([46]2000), and imperfect monitoring. The information assumptions generate the incentives required to sustain some debt and preserve a role for money, see Kocherlakota ([47]1998) and Wallace ([48]2010). Furthermore, the paper shows that through the commitment generated, it is possible to -- hinge on their absence. Quantitatively, the extent to which the model generates large money demand and coexistence with credit depends on the severity of the search friction and in particular, on the probability of finding goods. -- where the liquid asset has no value. Technically, money leads to a lower market tightness (firms over buyers) where the probability of selling goods is higher for firms relative to the nonmonetary equilibrium. So money is desirable because it increases firms' ability to sell, that is, their measured productivity and overall transactions.[54]7 Similarly, inflation erodes the willingness of buyers to hold money; this increases the velocity of money and induces the buyers to choose a market tightness where it is easier for them to find goods, but harder for firms to sell. As a result, inflation leads to a decline in measured aggregate productivity -- particular, a quantitative paper that builds on this theory finds the suggested search mechanism to be a powerful source of recessions: as matching conditions deteriorate, buyers do not spend their money and firms do not sell their goods (surge in liquid savings, spare production capacity, and decline in productivity). This way the model -- Instead, the market for goods is subject to a search friction.[64]9 Besides consumption and capital, there is money: a costlessly storable, divisible and intrinsically useless object. Since this asset is homogeneous, it is not subject to the search friction.

To clarify, it is useful to specify the following timing within the period. -- concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh (ii) After the input markets clear and before inputs are paid, households and firms meet in the frictional market. To pay, households can use money, bond holdings, or issue an intratemporal bond, a promise for later payment at the end of the period. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh (iii) Firms use the proceedings (money or bonds) to remunerate the inputs. At maturity, bonds clear in money, or by clearance of net bond positions.[71]13 It is shown that, absent a credit limit on the ability to issue such bonds, money has no value. However, a key point of the paper is that the credit necessary for that case is very large. To clarify that the resilience of money to credit does not come from any other missing markets, I also consider an intertemporal bond to roll over any existing debt. This bond is perfectly liquid in the sense that firms are indifferent between it and money. However, it is shown that this bond is not traded in equilibrium. -- that all these contracts are honored under the limited commitment that is enforceable with imperfect monitoring, which is required to make money essential as pointed out by Wallace ([73]2010). These frictions call for a limit on credit and an upper bound on the quantity q sold in a submarket. These two limits enable equilibrium with no endogenous default under the following assumption: to enter a submarket, one has to show proof of means, that is, one has to show enough money holdings and credit availability to afford the purchase in the submarket, should a match occur.[74]14 As in Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([75]2013), I -- frictions, has the same allocation as the neoclassical model, will help isolate the effects of the information frictions in the decentralized economy, and the role of money. From ([85]4), it is also possible to appreciate how the matching -- would be captured by a higher TFP parameter. So in this model, the Solow residual is endogenous. Intuitively, the higher ϕ, the less waste. Later, it is shown that also money holdings and velocity are related to the matching probabilities. -- encoding="application/x-tex">$p_m (m+\Delta m) +a$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] , where m is money held from the previous period, [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>p</mi> <mi>m</mi> </msub> <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$p_m$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] -- Nosal and Rocheteau [92]2011, among others), this approach seems the most appropriate for this paper as, up to the borrowing limit, credit is perfectly substitutable to money, making the coexistence problem more transparent because money has no transaction advantage.

Then, Section 2.4.1 shows that the decentralization is incentive compatible under the informational frictions that give money a role. Households that like the same variety can insure among themselves using -- However, they cannot tell the variety offered by each trading post before visiting it.[98]22 It should be noticed that this theory of money does not hinge on this insurance assumption: it would be possible to write the model without the insurance market and allow for heterogeneity to spread. -- </mrow> <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$p q_i(e,u;p)$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] in money or bonds.

A difference between the two cases above is that purchases from the firm q only appear in case of a match. -- The household problem with insurance The representative household starts each period with capital k, money m, and bonds a. For recursive equilibria, the aggregate state Ω is composed of the aggregate capital stock K and money M, and possibly of a vector of shocks with a known Markov process. The household solves the following problem with rational expectations: -- shown in ([115]16): the right-hand side shows the end of period balance after insurance, as elaborated earlier. From this latter equation, it is intuitive why money may have value in this economy: [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>ψ</mi> <mo><</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$\psi <1$</annotation> -- can be spent in goods. As formalized later, if B is not too large, the right-hand side of ([116]16) is positive, that is, there is left over wealth, which gives rise to money or bond demand. Since bonds are in zero net supply, in equilibrium [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msup> <mi>a</mi> <mo>′</mo> </msup> -- encoding="application/x-tex">$a^{\prime }=0$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] and there is positive money demand.[117]25 So, the harder it is to find goods (i.e., the smaller ψ), the larger -- Notice that the latter is a different explanation than the transaction one according to which money is acquired today in order to be able to purchase goods tomorrow. Rather, money is demanded because one was not able to make purchases today (store of value motive). This is an important distinction because, as argued next, in this model money is demanded even though it is dominated as a way to acquire goods (i.e., as a transaction means) and so it would not be demanded if it was not -- muted and instead highlight the role of the spending problem, notice that here, if the spending problem was addressed by giving an agent the chance to rebalance her money-goods holdings (similar to an end-of-period centralized market as in LW), she would spend everything to buy goods and leave with -- encoding="application/x-tex">$m^{\prime }=0$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] . This is because capital goods pay higher dividends than money and, crucially, they can be consumed at any time.[119]27 This does not mean that money does not have a transaction role: indeed money relaxes the transaction constraint ([120]14) and if it was not so, then money would not have value. But this motive alone would not be sufficient to demand money if an agent had a way to circumvent the spending problem because, as mentioned, agents prefer capital. Instead, in models that have a more prominent transaction role, agents do not turn all money into goods even without the spending problem as is the case in the centralized market in LW. This discussion highlights the importance of the spending friction to induce money demand. However, it should be noticed that households effectively choose the probability of finding goods ψ (and thereby end-of period money holdings) by choosing p and q, which determines market tightness given the equilibrium function [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>θ</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo> -- encoding="application/x-tex">$p_m m^{\prime } \rightarrow 0$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] and they are left with goods only. If households prefer goods to money, why would they willingly choose a low ψ and therefore to hold money? Intuitively, to overcome the friction and have [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>ψ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> -- </semantics> :MATH] is too expensive, so agents choose to leave funds unspent and store them in money. This portfolio choice is explained in detail next. The portfolio choice of turning liquid assets into goods The first-order condition for p illustrates the key trade-off in the decision of buying goods versus holding money. Focusing on an interior solution and assuming B independent of p for simplicity, the equation is -- : put differently, the goods constraint ([126]15) with multiplier λ[3] bites more than the financial constraint ([127]16) with multiplier λ[4] so that agents prefer goods to money.

In a nonmonetary equilibrium, the value of the supply of money is zero so v must adjust endogenously to ensure that agents do not demand excess liquidity. -- that all these contracts are honored under the limited commitment that is enforceable with imperfect monitoring, which is required to make money essential as pointed out by Kocherlakota ([146]1998) and Wallace ([147]2010). Agents can renege on any of the contracts mentioned above but the commitment is endogenized introducing participation constraints -- that one cannot simply assume perfect firm monitoring. In that case, there would be scope for a firm to become a market maker that collects all the money from the buyers before the matching process, and then use the proceedings to pay the trading posts that are successful. If that was possible, then the market maker could exploit the law of large numbers and ask just enough money to finance the determinisitic number of matches, see Faig and Huangfu ([166]2007). Instead, without the market maker, there is more money demand because buyers can only use their own liquidity in a match and so each buyer needs more money or credit than with the market maker. One final worry is that when the monitoring probability of the households tends to 1, for the incentive -- becomes irrelevant because as per Proposition [167]1, with perfect monitoring, any level of obligation is enforceable. And it is shown later that in such a case, money is not essential. 2 CHARACTERIZATION -- </semantics> :MATH] , then the candidate solution is not an equilibrium because the value of money would have to be negative. The strategy above works to the extent that given v, there is a unique -- constructed (because the debt limit need not be the “not too tight” one), there is a nonmonetary equilibrium with the same allocation. In this sense, money is not essential with perfect monitoring, confirming Wallace ([197]2010). Yet, from an empirical perspective, it is interesting that monetary equilibrium can be constructed even with -- <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$q(v)<B$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] and the value of money would have to be negative. Intuitively, money is not demanded if its return is too low, or equivalently, if inflation is too high. So there is an upper limit on inflation, which is tighter the -- <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$v\rightarrow \beta$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] is the Friedman Rule, in which case, inflation is negative and money gives the same return as capital. As a result there is no private cost of not finding goods and holding high liquidity so agents choose a market with low θ and low ψ. Instead, inflation prevents θ from going to its efficient lower bound because it makes it privately costly to hold money. This leads agents to choose markets with higher θ so that there is a higher probability of finding a match and spend the money. However, the higher the matching probability for a buyer, the lower it is for a seller. As shown studying the planning problem, low θ is -- In this model also, velocity is an endogenous function of θ. Indeed the velocity of broad money (i.e., money plus credit such as M1, M2, MZM) in this model is ψ. This is because velocity is defined as output over broad money, which in this model is equal to q. Since production is equal to [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>c</mi> <mo>+</mo> <msup> <mi>k</mi> -- It is now possible to appreciate better a key point of the paper, that is, the extent to which money is robust to credit. To this aim, it is useful to relate q to income. From equation ([205]16), and using the fact that in equilibrium -- smaller than 1 so that not all agents get to spend, then those in a match must spend more than their income. It follows that, for an equilibrium to exist, agents need spending capacity (money + credit) in excess of their individual income. As a result, money demand is positive even when credit is larger than individual income, but smaller than spending. Notice that this result comes from the general -- <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$B<q$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] money has value from ([206]14). This result is important because with B larger than income, it is possible to have outside + inside money larger than GDP, as in the data. -- . An intuition for why money is robust to credit larger than income goes as follows. Because of the search friction, some agents do not buy goods, yet they make income and want a store of value so that they can -- income. In Shi ([210]1997), the big family assumption is such that each family always has income equal to spending. As a result, in these frameworks, credit equal to income is enough for money not to have value. An example An example helps illustrate how useful money is in this economy. From Figure [211]1, it is evident that, given a borrowing limit, monetary equilibrium has higher q and lower v (or higher real interest rate -- , there is no nonmonetary equilibrium because the liquidity provided by credit is insufficient for an equilibrium without the further liquidity provided by money.

To paraphrase the result, liquidity (money + credit) must be sufficiently large to sustain production. The proposition highlights how thirsty of liquidity this economy is. In comparison, in transaction -- The model also has many implications that are in common with the new monetarist approach. In particular, it can be shown that money is neutral but not superneutral, that if B is “lump sum” in the sense that it is independent of the households inputs, then credit has no -- In 2020.II, M1 over quarterly GDP was 2.63; the ratio was 3.62 for either M2 or M3, and 4.19 for MZM. Furthermore, inside money alone (or credit) was larger than GDP. This is because at that time the monetary base (or outside money) was equal to 1.02 times GDP. So inside money measured, for example, through M2, was [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>2.6</mn> <mo>=</mo> <mn>3.62</mn> -- encoding="application/x-tex">$2.6=3.62-1.02$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] times quarterly GDP. That money and credit are larger than GDP is not just true during the pandemic. Prior the Covid-19 crisis (e.g., 2017.III), inside money M2−MB was [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>2.80</mn> <mo>−</mo> <mn>0.79</mn> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2.01</mn> </mrow> <annotation -- <mi>M</mi> </mrow> <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">$p_m M$</annotation> </semantics> :MATH] is outside money and B is equal to inside money (a liability of the private sector used as a medium of exchange, see Lagos [219]2008), so total liquidity, or inside and outside money together, is [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mi>p</mi> <mi>m</mi> </msub> <mi>M</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mi>B</mi> </mrow> <annotation -- , so it is possible to parameterize ψ to match the ratio between GDP and a measure of total liquidity such as M1, M2, M3, or MZM.[222]44 Then, it is possible to parameterize B to the amount of inside money to match both credit and outside money from ([223]14) so that [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>q</mi> <mo>=</mo> <msub> <mi>p</mi> <mi>m</mi> </msub> <mi>m</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mi>B</mi> </mrow> <annotation -- This procedure shows how to parameterize the model so that there is monetary equilibrium with the observed amount of money and credit.

However, the mechanism and the implications differ. In precautionary models, there is no search friction in buying goods but agents defer their spending for rainy days. Unlike the precautionary literature, here money is robust to insurance: even redistributing goods and money to insure against the matching risk, still there is money in excess of spending because, owing to the search friction and bilateral trading, each individual must carry the liquidity to make the initial transaction before redistribution can take place. Furthermore, money is robust to the presence of assets that pay higher dividends and that can be instantly turned into consumption. Instead, in Bewley models, it is necessary to give to money the advantage of being more easily turned into goods to buffer idiosyncratic shocks: see Wen ([234]2015) (alternatively, it is -- equilibrium: if the credit limit does not bind, it is possible to pool all liquid assets and those in a match can spend it all, leaving no residual wealth to be stored in money.

The main contribution to this literature is to use that mechanism to construct a theory of money. This way, it is possible to relate TFP to money velocity. Furthermore, Mennuni ([244]2021) shows that disciplining the model through monetary quantities has implications for the identification -- the public record accessible only to a group of the population.

It would be possible to relax the assumption of perfect substitutability and distinguish between money and government bonds by assuming a mild search friction for bonds. The intertemporal bond highlights that this theory of money does not rely on the fact that agents are not allowed intertemporal credit. In fact, without insurance, the bond would be traded but it would still be in aggregate zero net supply, thus leaving space for money demand to store the remaining unmatched aggregate savings. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 26 It could be argued that in real life one can invest unspent -- everyone. Furthermore, if one buys shares of firms who hold cash (or who hold shares of other firms who hold cash), one is holding cash. In this model, agents hold either money or capital directly, but one could conceive other decentralizations where firms hold capital and money, and issue shares. To make shares less liquid than money, one could assume a mild search friction on shares. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 27 Capital is introduced in an LW model in GMW, but agents are not allowed to consume it or trade it in the decentralized market. Lagos and Rocheteau ([257]2008) find conditions under which coexistence of money and capital is possible even when capital can be used for transactions in the decentralized market. However, they assume that capital cannot be directly consumed in the decentralized market. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 28 In a transaction framework, those are all the effects so that agents must be at the margin indifferent between goods and money in a centralized market. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 29 Without this assumption, a firm could open many trading posts -- </semantics> :MATH] , ([268]B3) and ([269]B4), imply an arbitrage condition: because bonds and money are equally liquid, they must give the same real return. In steady state, the real interest rate on bonds equals the inflation rate -- . This is a Fisher equation with the addition that, owing to the perfect substitutability between m and b, the nominal interest rate is infinitely elastic at 0. By governing money growth, the government sets inflation and v. Equivalently the government can set a policy for v and let money supply accommodate money demand. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 33 The latter condition implies that the equilibrium p is normalized to 1. -- to make m fully observable would require more information than showing proof of means: one thing is to show one has a given amount of money, another is to prove that that is all the money one has. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 35 This is because q is increasing in θ so the constraint on q also restricts θ.

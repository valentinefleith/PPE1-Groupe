What actually is money? How is it created and what is the ECB’s role? [36]Tell me: What is a central bank? The changing essence of money The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually commodity money – an object made of something that had a market value, such as a gold coin. Later on, representative money consisted of banknotes that could be swapped against a certain amount of gold or silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a central bank but, unlike representative money, cannot be converted into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. It has no intrinsic value – the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless – yet is still accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the central bank to keep the value of money stable over time. If central banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money would lose its general acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store of value. The nature of money over time Present-day currency can also exist independently of a physical representation. Money can exist in a bank account in the form of a computer entry or stored in the form of a savings account. Digital cash, or e-money, is monetary value stored in a pre-paid card or smartphone, for example. And direct debits, internet payments and card transfers are all forms of payment that do not involve cash. (There are even newer decentralised digital currencies or [37]virtual currency schemes like Bitcoin that exist without a central point of control like a central bank. These are not regarded as money from a legal perspective.) -- form the Eurosystem. The uses of money and how the ECB keeps track of it Money, whatever its form, has three different functions. It is a medium -- For example, many of the circulating €50 notes are hoarded. The functions of money Central banks usually define and monitor several monetary aggregates. Developments in these aggregates can reveal useful information about money and prices. Several aggregates are needed because many different financial assets are substitutable and the nature and characteristics of financial assets, transactions and means of payment change over -- policy strategy. How is money created? The ECB acts as a bank for the commercial banks and this is also how it influences the flow of money and credit in the economy to achieve stable prices. Commercial banks, in turn, can borrow money, i.e. central bank reserves, from the ECB, usually to cover very short-term liquidity needs. The ECB’s main tool for controlling the quantity of “outside” money, and hence the demand for central bank reserves by commercial banks, is setting very short-term interest rates – the “cost of money”. Money creation in the euro area Commercial banks can also create so-called “inside” money, i.e. bank deposits – this happens every time they issue a new loan. The difference between outside and inside money is that the former is an asset for the economy as a whole, but it is nobody’s liability. Inside money, on the other hand, is named this way because it is backed by private credit: if all the claims held by banks on private debtors were to be settled, the inside money created would be reversed to zero. So, it is one form of currency that is created – and can be reversed – within the private economy. What about the ECB’s “money-printing” scheme I keep reading about? In practice, only the national central banks physically issue euro -- reserves that can help reduce – through a variety of channels – the interest rates faced by households and firms with a view to supporting the economy and, ultimately, to keep the value of money stable when the room to cut those interest rates directly controlled by the ECB is limited. In this process, the ECB does not actually print banknotes to pay for the assets but creates money electronically, which is credited to the seller or intermediary, e.g. a commercial bank. The seller can then use the additional liquidity to buy other assets or, in case of a -- Here is a challenge for you! Test how much you know about money with this interactive quiz.

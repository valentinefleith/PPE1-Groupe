   Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as
   payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes,
   in a particular country or socio-economic context.^[1]^[2]^[3] The
   primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a
   unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred
   payment.

   Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed
   intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems
   are based on unbacked fiat money without use value.^[4] Its value is
   consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a
   government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be
   accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for
   "all debts, public and private", in the case of the United States
   dollar.

   The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation
   (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular
   definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in
   checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts).
   Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions
   and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment,
   forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.

Etymology

   The word money derives from the Latin word moneta with the meaning
   "coin" via French monnaie. The Latin word is believed to originate from
   a temple of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the
   ancient world, Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno
   Moneta at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was
   located.^[5] The name "Juno" may have derived from the Etruscan goddess
   Uni and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or
   instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

   In the Western world a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie,
   stemming from Latin in specie, meaning "in kind".^[6]

   Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of
   commodity money. The Mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight, and
   relied on the mass of something like 160 grains of barley.^[12] The
   first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. Societies
   in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used shell money—often, the
   shells of the cowry (Cypraea moneta L. or C. annulus L.). According to
   Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to introduce the use of
   gold and silver coins.^[13] It is thought by modern scholars that these
   first stamped coins were minted around 650 to 600 BC.^[14]
   [170px-Jiao_zi.jpg] Song Dynasty Jiaozi, the world's earliest paper

   The system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of
   representative money.^[citation needed] This occurred because gold and
   silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors,
   redeemable for the commodity money deposited. Eventually, these
   receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used
   as money. Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the
   Song dynasty. These banknotes, known as "jiaozi", evolved from
   promissory notes that had been used since the 7th century. However,
   they did not displace commodity money and were used alongside coins. In
   the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the
   accounts of travellers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck.^[15]
   Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty is the
   subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled
   "How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like
   Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country."^[16] Banknotes were
   first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco in 1661 and were again also
   used alongside coins. The gold standard, a monetary system where the
   medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set,
--
   the convertibility of the dollar to gold. After this many countries
   de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the
   world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments'
   fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods
   via payment. According to proponents of modern money theory, fiat money
   is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for
   the currency they issue.^[17]

   In Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons
   famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a medium of
   exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of
   value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919,
   Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet:

          Money's a matter of functions four,
          A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.^[18]

   This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics
--
   but rather subsuming it in the others.^[4]^[20]^[21]

   There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of
   money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that
   a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these
   arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange conflicts
   with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value
   requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of
   exchange requires it to circulate.^[22] Others argue that storing of
   value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact
   that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across
   space and time. The term "financial capital" is a more general and
   inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a
   uniformly recognized tender.

   Main article: Medium of exchange

   When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services,
   it is performing a function as a medium of exchange. It thereby avoids
   the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the inability to
   permanently ensure "coincidence of wants". For example, between two
--
   and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for
   the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.

   Money acts as a standard measure and a common denomination of trade. It
   is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary
   for developing efficient accounting systems like double-entry
   bookkeeping.
--
   particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other
   functions.^[4]^[20]^[21]^[clarification needed] A "standard of deferred
   payment" is an accepted way to settle a debt—a unit in which debts are
   denominated, and the status of money as legal tender, in those
   jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for
   the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real
   value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation, and for
   sovereign and international debts via debasement and devaluation.

--

   Main article: Store of value

   To act as a store of value, money must be able to be reliably saved,
   stored, and retrieved—and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange
   when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable
   over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of
   money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of
   value.^[4]^[failed verification]

Properties

   The functions of money are that it is a medium of exchange, a unit of
   account, and a store of value.^[24] To fulfill these various functions,
   money must be:^[25]
     * Fungible: its individual units must be capable of mutual
       substitution (i.e., interchangeability).
     * Durable: able to withstand repeated use.
     * Divisible: divisible to small units.
     * Portable: easily carried and transported.
     * Acceptable: most people must accept the money as payment
     * Scarce: its supply in circulation must be limited.^[25]

Money supply

   Main article: Money supply

   In economics, money is any financial instrument that can fulfill the
   functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments
   together are collectively referred to as the money supply of an
   economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial
   instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or
   services. Since the money supply consists of various financial
   instruments (usually currency, demand deposits, and various other types
   of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding
   together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.

   Economists employ different ways to measure the stock of money or money
   supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a
   categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial
   instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates
   (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2, and M3. These
   are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and
   bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus
   savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; M3 is M2 plus larger
--
   instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2, etc. may be different in
   different countries.

   Another measure of money, M0, is also used. M0 is base money, or the
   amount of money actually issued by the central bank of a country. It is
   measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at
   the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the
   reserve requirements of commercial banks.

  Creation of money

   In current economic systems, money is created by two
   procedures:^[citation needed]

   Legal tender, or narrow money (M0) is the cash created by a Central
   Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.

   Bank money, or broad money (M1/M2) is the money created by private
   banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients,
   with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money
   is created as electronic money.

   Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions
   and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment,
   forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed
   countries.^[26]^[27]^[28]

   In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by
   commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions,
   banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that
   savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to
   create new loans and deposits.^[29]

  Market liquidity
--
   Main article: Market liquidity

   "Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for
   another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is
   the most liquid asset because it is universally recognized and accepted
   as a common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to
   trade goods and services easily without having to barter.

   Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low
   transaction costs. There should be no (or minimal) spread between the
   prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.

Types

  Commodity

   Main article: Commodity money

   [170px-1914_Sydney_Half_Sovereign_-_St._George.jpg] A 1914 British gold
   sovereign

   Many items have been used as commodity money such as naturally scarce
   precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads, etc., as well as many
   other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value
   comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself
   constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.^[30] Examples of
   commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold,
   silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones,
   decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc.
   These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in
   conjunction with one another, in various commodity valuation or price
   system economies. The use of commodity money is similar to barter, but
   a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for
   the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins
   such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record
   of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this
   is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value
--

  Representative

   Main article: Representative money

   In 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the
   money used at the time as "representative money". Representative money
   is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other physical
   tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed
   quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of
   representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the
   commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that
   commodity.^[33]

  Fiat

   Main article: Fiat money

   [170px-2006_AEGold_Proof_Rev.png] Gold coins are an example of legal
   tender that are traded for their intrinsic value, rather than their
   face value.

   Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from
   any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a
   valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by
   government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat
--
   face value (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion
   value).^[32]^[36]

   Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or
   coins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money
   has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the
   same laws that created the money can also define rules for its
   replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S.
   government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat
   money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or
   if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.^[37] By contrast,
   commodity money that has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.

  Coinage

--

   In premodern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium
   that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led
   to the introduction of paper money. This economic phenomenon was a slow
   and gradual process that took place from the late Tang dynasty
   (618–907) into the Song dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for
   merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as
--
   century the government finally took over these shops to produce
   state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally
   valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a
   standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an
   acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of
   woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the
   11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money
   in premodern China.

   At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous
   monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis

   institutions for loans and deposits.^[39]^[need quotation to verify]

   In Europe, paper money was first introduced in Sweden in 1661. Sweden
   was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value,
   extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be
   made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced
--
   However, these advantages are held within their disadvantages. First,
   since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing
   authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it
   with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased
   inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th
   century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an
   inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding
   hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The
   printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of
   wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army.
   For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility
   in Europe and America. It was also addictive since the speculative
   profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations
   established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their
   treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.

   At this time both silver and gold were considered legal tender, and
--
   [220px-Sweet_success.jpg] A check, used as a means of converting funds
   in a demand deposit to cash

   Commercial bank money or demand deposits are claims against financial
   institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A
   demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn
   at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or
--
   checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or
   through online banking.^[40]

   Commercial bank money is created by commercial banks whose reserves
   (held as cash and other highly liquid assets) typically constitute only
   a fraction of their deposits, while the banks maintain an obligation to
   redeem all these deposits upon demand - a practise known as
   fractional-reserve banking.^[41] Commercial bank money differs from
   commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as
   its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and
   other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of
   risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution
   becomes insolvent.

   The money multiplier theory presents the process of creating commercial
   bank money as a multiple (greater than 1) of the amount of base money
   created by the country's central bank, the multiple itself being a
   function of the legal regulation of banks imposed by financial
   regulators (e.g., potential reserve requirements) beside the business
   policies of commercial banks and the preferences of households -
   factors which the central bank can influence, but not control
   completely.^[42] Contemporary central banks generally do not control
   the creation of money, nor do they try to, though their interest
   rate-setting monetary policies naturally affect the amount of loans and
   deposits that commercial banks create.^[43]^[44]^[45]

  Digital or electronic

   Main article: Digital money

   The development of computer technology in the second part of the
   twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990,
   in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and
   commercial banks was in electronic form. By the 2000s most money
   existed as digital currency in bank databases.^[46] In 2012, by number
   of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic
   (dependent on country).^[47]

   Anonymous digital currencies were developed in the early 2000s. Early
   examples include Ecash, bit gold, RPOW, and b-money. Not much
   innovation occurred until the conception of Bitcoin in 2008, which
   introduced the concept of a decentralised currency that requires no
   trusted third party.^[48]

   When gold and silver were used as money, the money supply could grow
   only if the supply of these metals was increased by mining. This rate
   of increase would accelerate during periods of gold rushes and
   discoveries, such as when Columbus traveled to the New World and
--
   down. However, if the rate of gold mining could not keep up with the
   growth of the economy, gold became relatively more valuable, and prices
   (denominated in gold) would drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the
   more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money
   backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.

   Modern-day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer
   tied to the value of gold. The amount of money in the economy is
   influenced by monetary policy, which is the process by which a central
   bank influences the economy to achieve specific goals. Often, the goal
   of monetary policy is to maintain low and stable inflation, directly
--

   Monetary policy strategies have changed over time.^[52] Some of the
   tools used to conduct contemporary monetary policy include:^[53]
     * changing the interest rate at which the central bank loans money to
       (or borrows money from) the commercial banks
     * open market operations including currency purchases or sales
     * forward guidance, i.e. publishing forecasts to communicate the
       likely future course of monetary policy
--

   During the 1970s and 1980s monetary policy in several countries was
   influenced by an economic theory known as monetarism. Monetarism argued
   that management of the money supply should be the primary means of
   regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money
   prior to the 1980s was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna
   Schwartz^[54] supported by the work of David Laidler,^[55] and many
   others. It turned out, however, that maintaining a monetary policy
   strategy of targeting the money supply did not work very well: The
   relation between money growth and inflation was not as tight as
   expected by monetarist theory, and the short-run relation between the
   money supply and the interest rate, which is the chief instrument
   through which the cental bank can influence output and inflation, was
   unreliable. Both problems were due to unpredictable shifts in the
   demand for money. Consequently, starting in the early 1990s a
   fundamental reorientation took place in most major central banks,
   starting to target inflation directly instead of the money supply and
   using the interest rate as their main instrument.^[56]

   The definition of money says it is money only "in a particular country
   or socio-economic context". In general, communities only use a single
   measure of value, which can be identified in the prices of goods listed
   for sale. There might be multiple media of exchange, which can be
   observed by what is given to purchase goods ("medium of exchange"),
   etc. In most countries, the government acts to encourage a particular

   Some places do maintain two or more currencies, particularly in border
   towns or high-travel areas. Shops in these locations might list prices

   traders.

   Communities can change the money they use, which is known as currency
   substitution. This can happen intentionally, when a government issues a
   new currency. For example, when Brazil moved from the Brazilian
   cruzeiro to the Brazilian real. It can also happen spontaneously, when
   the people refuse to accept a currency experiencing hyperinflation
   (even if its use is encouraged by the government).

   The money used by a community can change on a smaller scale. This can
   come through innovation, such as the adoption of cheques (checks).
   Gresham's law says that "bad money drives out good". That is, when
   buying a good, a person is more likely to pass on less-desirable items
   that qualify as "money" and hold on to more valuable ones. For example,
   coins with less silver in them (but which are still valid coins) are
   more likely to circulate in the community. This may effectively change
   the money used by a community.

   The money used by a community does not have to be a currency issued by
   a government. A famous example of community adopting a new form of
   money is prisoners-of-war using cigarettes to trade.^[57]

  Counterfeiting

   Main article: Counterfeit money

   Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal
   sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit
   money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as
   money itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of
   Lydian coins which are thought to be among the first western
   coins.^[58] Historically, objects that were difficult to counterfeit
   (e.g. shells, rare stones, precious metals) were often chosen as
   money.^[59] Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent
   method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or
   silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by
   legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During

       argues, "Banks create money by issuing a loan to a borrower; they
       record the loan as an asset, and the money they deposit in the
       borrower’s account as a liability. This, in one way, is no
       different to the way the Federal Reserve creates money ... money is
       simply a third party’s promise to pay which we accept as full
       payment in exchange for goods. The two main third parties whose
       promises we accept are the government and the banks ... money ...
       is not backed by anything physical, and instead relies on trust. Of
       course, that trust can be abused ... we continue to ignore the main
       game: what the banks do (for good and for ill) that really drives
       the economy." Forbes

Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

   Published on:

   26 April 2023

   The Money and Pensions Service has produced a new guide that shows
   creditors how to offer more support to customers living with a mental
   health problem. Living with a mental health problem can make it more
   difficult to interact with and manage money, including payments to
   financial services providers, public sector creditors and utility
   providers.

How the Mental Health and Money guide was created

   ‘Mental Health and Money’ was created after detailed consultation with
   experts in both financial wellbeing and mental health.

   The guidance is supported by the Money and Mental Health Policy
   Institute, Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and Citizens Advice, along with
   Adferiad Recovery in Wales, MindWise in Northern Ireland and Scottish
   organisations Change Mental Health and Citizens Advice Scotland.

   Money and Mental Health Policy Institute showing one in five people
   (18%) living with a mental health problem are also in problem debt.

   However, we also know that there is a lot of information out there

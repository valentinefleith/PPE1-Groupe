I think it would be possibly interesting and fulfilling to help other people sort out their finances. I like being paid for my time, but this would be a pocket money type idea. But I'm wondering if it's more trouble than it's worth - would I need some level of financial accreditation? How would it work cross border (I live in France, I would want to deal with mostly British or -- see these things on your budget, can you replace with x, y, or z; you should open and use this kind of account; and so on. I'm wondering - is this worth the hassle? More trouble than it's worth? I guess the liability thing kicks in when money is exchanged, and that's mostly what I'm concerned about (this is not the USA; I'm unlikely to be sued, but still, I don't want to take the risk for 50 Euros for a couple of hours or more of work!!). -- IÂm actually in the process of making a career change into financial planning, but am seriously considering starting a financial coaching business to start out and gain some hands-on, client-facing practical experience helping people as well as generating some money.

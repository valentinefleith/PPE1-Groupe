   Ok so if I want to transfer money and equipment to a diffrent map, I
   use money boxes.
   But it's hard to get it perfect so if I give myself too much money,
   what's the fastest way to get rid of it? :gamer:

   Yeah rent and maybe get some workers leave them sitting there, put
   something in the way.. turn growth off your fields and fast forward.
   Surley if you leave that running the money should be gone.

   and the;
   bankofhagenstedt
   file if you use it. A free program called Notepad++ is a good option to
   edit them, linked below. Match the money in both or you will restart
   and find the money back to where it was. Also make sure you use the
   correct Save number file. Just put the exact amount you should have, no
   messing or guesswork involved. Not worth cheating. I never put in more
   than I should have. Only adjust it if the system rips me off.

   played 3 different maps before, until I started Westbridge Hills a week
   or so ago..I have enjoyed this just as much as every before..and I have
   not cheated in a single dollar. I collected the gold nuggets(just by
   looking around for the first 10..), and used the money to buy the Big
   Bud 450 and a larger cultivator and seeder, and hay equipment. Since
   then, I've just been farming away, slowly gaining money. As I said
   above, I've found this to be the most enjoyable way to play, and I've
   played a lot across 4 versions of the game.

   It isn't really. People work out how much their old farm is worth and
   then use the money cheat to raise that amount at the start of a new
   game.

   brackets can be put into

   brackets, right?
   As for your question red- the fastest way to lose money is to pay off
   what you can of your loan, then buy and sell equipment till you're
   close to the amount you want

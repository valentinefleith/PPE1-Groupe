Claim your money back concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py Thread starter GeogeHalin concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py Start date Nov 10, 2013 -- Hello! My mom called me this morning and asked me to do grocery shopping for her. She had not given me the money so she suggested I use my own pocket money to do the shopping and she would give the money back to me when she returned home. This is what she said: 1. Please do the grocery shopping. You can claim your money back. That sounds quite odd to me. Do native speakers use it in this way?

If on the other hand the office has run out of pens, he might ask you to go out to the shops and buy some, get a receipt and then "You can claim your money back". L -- concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py #5 I agree with DonnyB. "You can claim your money back" sounds too formal and a bit abstract for a personal arrangement. It does not say WHERE the money can be claimed back from thus hinting that it isn't necessarily the person who is saying it. Using "claimed" might suggest that a request would have to be be submitted eg fill in a formal expense or petty cash claim form and -- concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh temp.sh tokeniser.ipynb tokeniser.py #7 In AE, we would be much more likely to say "I'll pay you back." "I'll give you your money back" sounds as though I had your money in the first place: perhaps you gave me some money to buy something for you, and I couldn't do so. That's when I'd use that phrase. DonnyB -- Click to expand... Yes. Whatever phrase you use, you need to somehow include the idea of "back", because you paid out the money in the first place. sdgraham -- DonnyB said: Yes.

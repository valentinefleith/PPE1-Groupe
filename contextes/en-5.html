If I wanted to transfer some money from my French bank account to my English bank account, do I have to declare or mention it somewhere? Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of money I am transferring to the Uk? And what is the maximum amount I can transfer in one go? Thank you HMRC Admin 3 -- Joe Kycheto Posted Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:14:45 GMT by Joe Kycheto I’m a Canadian citizen, resident in the UK and wish to transfer monies from Canada to the UK. The money was left to me by my late mother and relevant taxes have been paid in Canada. It’s not income so I can’t see that I’d need to pay income tax on the UK on it ? Would this be correct please ? Thanks in advance. Joe. -- me around £400K (interest-free) from Singapore. Before receiving £400K from Singapore, I would like to ask some questions and hope somebody can give me some suggestions: (1) As a non-UK citizen, could I use the borrowed money for the property purchase? (cash buyer) (2) If I can use the borrowed money for the property purchase, do I need to declare the large money transaction with HMRC? Like tax paying. Big thanks HMRC Admin 5 Posted Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:28:01 GMT by HMRC Admin 5 Hello cs535. -- Hello Xiang Li. For income tax purposes, you do not need to notify us of your Capital your bank account or if you transfer your money to a UK account. Thank You. Konstantinos Tsitsilonis Posted Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:44:03 GMT by Konstantinos Tsitsilonis Good morning. My father who has a savings account in one UK bank is planning on transfering money to my account in another UK bank, and neither of these accounts are joint accounts (I am not in his accound and he is not in mine). Will he or myself have to pay any taxes on that transfer? If so, is there a limit in the money transfered above which I will get taxed? Thanks for your help in advance. D0minika Posted Fri, 05 Mar 2021 18:46:34 GMT by D0minika Hi My friends based in France want to send me some money to UK. Is there a limit and do I need to declare it? Answer HMRC Admin 5 -- Posted Wed, 10 Mar 2021 12:34:07 GMT by taimmah Hello - I moved to the UK just over five months ago. I've been renting an apartment with my wife and children since November. And working for a UK-based company since Oct. I have money held in a foreign account and would like to transfer the sums into my UK accounts. Do I need to notify HMRC about this transfer? This is money I have saved from previous jobs before moving to the UK. Thank you.

I am arranging to move money from my overseas accounts to the UK. Part of the money moving in will be used towards the purchase of a residential house for my son in the UK. He is currently a non-resident and will be a tax-resident in the year 2021-2022. Need my son or I pay UK tax for the money transfer? Does it require for any declaration of the transfer to the HMRC? Will there be any difference if the money transfer between our accounts (UK accounts) occur before and after financial year cut-off of 5April2021? Thank you.

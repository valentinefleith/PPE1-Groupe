   Must have a thick skin and enjoy running about in the park! I tell
   everyone I can about this side gig because making 45 bucks watching 14
   year old girls (they rarely foul each other) have fun outside on a
   sunny afternoon is like stealing money.

   I work at an auto parts store on the weekends. It started off as a
   summer job in college. I worked full time during the summers and part
   time during the semesters. I just continued working there even after I
   graduated. I enjoy it, it puts extra money in my pocket, and I get a
   really big discount on parts, which I've used countless times and has
   saved me thousands of dollars.

   i'm a full time physician so not a whole lot of extra time but...
   i opened a mechanic shop and had my mechanic friend (who became my
   partner) run it for a while...
   made some money but i reinvested a lot of it too...
   it was good because he pretty much ran it and i did all the book
   keeping, financing etc...
   i was on fiverr.com for a while and it wasn't too bad but needed a lot

   in college i went around computer shops and asked them for the parts
   they didn't need (old hard drives etc)...
   and would get all the info, make a nice posting and sell on ebay....
   that actually was really good money....

     IMO: If you have a hobby you enjoy and someone pays for your raw
     materials and you come out at $0 an hour: you come out ahead.

   My feelings exactly!  I would do this for free, so the money is like a
   super bonus!

   I'm a web developer by trade and did some on the side consulting for
   about a year before I got burnt out. Wasn't a fan of 60-65 hour work
   weeks  and my friends harassing me for never being available on the
   weekends. It's not like I NEEDED the extra money.
   Since then I've been building and redesigning/updating websites for
   small businesses in the area, mostly for people I know. I typically do
   any side projects during the winter - I hate being stuck inside in the

   for 12 years. I only do about $1000/year now - but when I started out,
   I had a low-paying entry-level job in my field, and the extra cash
   covered most of my grad school tuition. But it was a lot of work and I
   probably didn't crack $10/hour - I had more time than money back then.
   Nowadays I only do it if I happen to run across something and I think I
   can make at least $50 without much effort. Those opportunities are
   pretty scarce in the niche markets I know well. If I wanted to ramp up

   I used to make money playing online Poker, but soon after I quit I
   believe it became illegal.  Ended up being 8-10 dollars an hour profit,
   but it wasn't good for my mood.

   small businesses,  At $50 an hour I'm pretty happy, and I know I could
   make and charge more if I were to really push it, but I am a very busy
   person already so I usually let the work find me.   If I were young and
   single and didn't want to work for "the man"???  There is good money
   here, certainly qualifies for one of those 50K+ jobs without a degree
   that MMM recently posted about.  If I were out of work I am confident I
   could fall back on this.

   When I started I had a classified ad, now I have enough
   referrals/regulars to stay as busy as I would like to be during the
   season. Average job is about 4-5 hours and 30-40 gifts.
   I find a perverse satisfaction in making money from other people's
   consumerism LOL.

   Keeping eyes and ears open for good deals. It is mostly just simple
   math and the initiative to do it.
   A friend buys up land with timber.  He typically is dealing with
   uneducated people who need money fast and have no clue of  the value of
   the timber. He can buy the land for $40k cash, thin the land and get
   $50k in timber and then subdivide the land. This is not his full time
   job, he just started doing it as a side project.

   I have down a lot of side gigs in my life.  Currently I have a few
   people that I dog sit for.  I either watch the dogs at my house or stay
   at their house when they are away, if they want me to take care of
   other things while they are away.  It's pretty easy money, and I
   usually bring in about an additional 200.00 a year.  It's not a huge
   amount, but something I enjoy.
   I also played baseball in college, and was giving private baseball

   This is brilliant.

     poker!  So maybe it isn't so frowned upon.  Certainly surprised me,
     though!

   Just FYI: opportunities to make money playing online poker in the USA
   are very limited. You can play on ultimatepoker if you are in Nevada,
   and that's just about it. If you live outside the US, you have vast
   options, but post Black Friday (that's what we call the day the feds

   As far as casino poker, I'd recommend building your bankroll up as
   quickly as possible to get out of 1/2 NLHE - the rake is too high and
   eats up your profit. 2/5 and up is probably best.
   In my opinion, poker is the most fun I've ever had making money! If you
   can do it - more power to you!
   I currently make my living as a gaming consultant and poker tournament
   player :-)

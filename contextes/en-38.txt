   Receiving money via PayPal: good thing or bad thing?

   Hi everyone,
   I have some questions regarding payments via PayPal... Up to now I've
   always refused to accept payments via PayPal, because I'll get charged
   to receive the money. Recently, however, I've turned down quite a lot
   of job offers for precisely this reason and I'm wondering if I should
   change my thinking...
   I'd really like to know why so many agencies prefer to pay via PayPal

   Hi everyone,
   I have some questions regarding payments via PayPal... Up to now I've

   of job offers for precisely this reason and I'm wondering if I should
   change my thinking...
   I'd really like to know why so many agencies prefer to pay via PayPal
   rather than bank transfer - can anyone shed some light on that please?
   All I know is that sending money via PayPal is free and some banks
   charge commission for international transfers (although I've never
   incurred any, neither when sending nor when receiving money). In fact
   an agency in Spain said that they do get charged high rates - so I
   guess every country is different? I really think there must be more
   advantages for the companies sending the money - is it extremely
   time-saving for example? At the moment I can only see the disadvantages
   for me and I'd like to understand both sides of the argument.
   What are your experiences with being paid via PayPal? Do agencies

   You'll often get charged to receive money by bank transfer as well

   My bank charges $15 USD for incoming wires. For amounts under $500
   Paypal fees are less than my bank fees, and for trivial projects of
   several hundred words it makes no sense to use anything but Paypal.
   It's certainly a much simpler affair to send money by Paypal than by
   bank transfer, even if you can do it through internet banking - there
   are less hurdles to clear, less forms to fill, no bank codes and SWIFT
   codes to deal with, usually very little bank/national regulations r...

   accept transfers in their currencies without charges.
   What fees are concerned, it's a compromise to consider. If the fees
   make the job unprofitable, then I would refuse it. If you can earn
   enough money working for clients that don't require Paypal, then you
   can turn them down. Otherwise, it's simply a part of normal and
   deductible business expenses. ^ Collapse

   shop online. These days, I use payments received through PayPal for

   So, essentially, there is only PayPal and Skrill. Skrill is cheaper
   (even if you tell your client that he can deduct the Skrill fee off
   your invoice) but does not work in the USA.
   Other options for money sending include:
   * Western Union (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money
   in person, can take several days for transfer)
   * Moneygram (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money in
   person, can take several days for transfer)
   * WorldRemit (somewhat limited number of country-to-country
   combinations, USD 4 per transaction)

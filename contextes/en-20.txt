EUROPEAN MONEY WEEK

All around Europe

20-25 March 2023

WHAT IS EUROPEAN MONEY WEEK?

   Starting on Monday 20 March 2023, European Money Week will celebrate
   financial education and raise awareness about money and personal
   finances. Throughout this week, many financial education events will be
   organized across Europe by national banking associations and the
   European Banking Federation.

   European Money Week is an annual initiative, aligned with OECD’s Global
   Money Week. It involves young people in more than 35 European
   countries, with activities ranging from classroom teaching sessions,
   seminars and conferences and of course the European Money Quiz. All
   activities seek to improve financial literacy through better financial
   education. European Money Week is an integral part of EBF’s mission to
   promote financial literacy in Europe through events, publications and
   partnerships.

EUROPEAN MONEY QUIZ

   The European Money Quiz is a new initiative for 13-15-year-olds.
   Teenagers across 28 European countries play against each other. First,
   there will be a national selection between classrooms, with a live quiz
   where thousands of classrooms can directly play against each other. In
   most countries, these contests will be played in March, during or
   around European Money Week. Then, the winners of these national
   selections will be invited to travel to Brussels for the European Money
   Quiz finals.

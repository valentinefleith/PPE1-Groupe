   There is a phrase in persian that conveys the idea of borrowing money
   from someone and never give it back to him.
   the exact translation is "Has somebody ever eaten your money?"
   the question is, Do we say the same thing in English?

   Are you sure?
   because I saw a movie where the guy was shaking the vending machine so
   that he can get a Pepsi out of it.
   His friend came by and said: "Did it eat your money?"

   That's a good saying! The nearest I can think of would be "to be a
   money-pit" and it is usually used of things rather than people.
   e.g. John was building his own aeroplane, so far it had cost him
   $200,000 and the project was only half-finished. He could have bought a
   new and better aeroplane for $300,000 - the project was a money pit.
   Of people, there is the phrase, "to be high-maintenance" e.g. John
   regretted giving Jane the use of his credit card. She had turned out to
   be a high-maintenance girlfriend; she spent over $1,000 a week on

   We do burn money though, meaning spending too much and without any
   control over the process. Would this match your Persian phrase? Some
   other European languages do use an equivalent to eat.
   Whilst writing this reply I suddenly realised that we do eat money

   Yes, but "it" is not "somebody". Do you mean "something"?

   Thank you guys. But there's a little difference between what you said
   and what I actually meant by eating money.
   Let me put it this way.
   Ali: Hey, did you manage to get your money back from the guy who
   borrowed it 3 months ago?
   Darius: Nope! He ate my money and disappeared. He took advantage of my
   friendship and my trust.
   The idea I'm trying to convey here, is the fact that some people,
   borrow some money from you, or get a certain amount of it from you with
   the promise of a good investment along with a huge profit. but after a
   while it turns out that they fooled you and disappeared with your
   money.
   In this case, Persian people say "He ate your money"
   What do you guys say in English?

   It makes a lot more sense now that you have put some context with it.

   We might say "He tricked you out of your money". I like your phrase
   better; it's more expressive, even if less idiomatic.

   pleasures of learning another language, learning the way that other
   cultures paint word pictures.
   A few that come to mind:
   "He ran through my money and then took off."
   "He burned through my money and then took off."
   "He mooched off of me and then took off."
   "He spent my money like it was water and then took off."

How to find unclaimed money from the government

   Find unclaimed funds held by the government that might be owed to you.

What is unclaimed money?

   If a business, financial institution, or government owes you money that
   you did not collect, it is considered unclaimed money or property.

   You may be able to file for unclaimed money owed to you or that was
   owed to a deceased relative if you are their legal heir.

Search by state

   Most unclaimed money is held by state governments from sources such as
   bank accounts, insurance policies, or state agencies.

   Search for unclaimed money from your [34]state’s unclaimed property
   office. If you have lived in other states, check their unclaimed
   property offices, too.

Search other databases

   There is no single government database for all unclaimed money. Use
   each separate database in the links below to search for each type of
   unclaimed money.
   Search for unclaimed money Database or agency

   Employers
     * Unpaid wages – [35]Search the Department of Labor’s database for

       refund.

   Taxes

       have not received your tax refund.
     * Stimulus checks – If you were eligible but did not receive one of
       the Economic Impact Payments, you may need to file or amend a tax
       return for 2020 or 2021. See the [40]IRS guidelines for filing for
       a recovery rebate credit.

How to talk to your children about money

   Children who are better with money tend to have learnt these skills
   from their parents or carers. Giving your child the opportunity to
   spend and save from an early age allows them to develop the skills they
   need to make good choices about money now and in the future.

What’s in this guide

     * [204]Talking to children about money can be difficult
     * [205]It’s easier than you think
     * [206]Start when your child is still young
     * [207]You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money
     * [208]A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   As a parent or carer, you are the most important influence on your
   child’s attitude to money. And you can help them to learn the essential
   skills they’ll use to manage money throughout their lives.

   We’ll show you how to help 3 to 11 year olds understand:
     * where money comes from and what you use it for
     * how to make good choices and learn from their mistakes
     * the benefits of saving
     * how to make choices about what to buy with the money they have
     * the difference between wants and needs.

   Supporting your child to build a healthy relationship with money
   doesn’t happen overnight. Talking openly and practising in real life
   will help your child to pick up the skills they need.

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

It’s never too early to talk money

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

   We want our children to grow up feeling confident about managing money.
   However, it’s often difficult to talk about money – it can be an
   emotional topic, especially if you have had your own issues with it or
   feel you would say the wrong thing.


   You may feel that money discussions are better left until your child is
   older. But this can stop them from developing the skills they need to
   look after their money in the long term.
   [209]Back to top

It’s easier than you think

   The good news is you don’t have to manage your own money perfectly to
   be able to teach your children good habits. You just need to decide
   what you want to teach them and keep it simple.

   Little and often is the best approach. Doing fun activities together
   also helps them to learn through real-life experiences. Making these
   conversations and activities a part of daily life will teach your
   children the skills they need.
   [210]Back to top

Start when your child is still young

   Our habits around money can start to form from around the age of seven.
   This includes whether you spend money straight away or like to save up.
   Children learn not just from what you tell them but from what they see
   you doing, so starting early helps to build good habits.

   There’s no reason not to talk to your kids about money from as young as
   three years old.

   This will help them:
     * Get the practice they need – learning how to manage money doesn’t
       happen overnight. Children need to build up their knowledge over
       time. They learn by taking lots of small steps and having
       opportunities to use money in real life.
     * Learn from their mistakes – this helps them to understand the
       consequences of the decisions they make. For example, if they spend
       all their money on sweets and can’t afford a new toy, they’re
       learning reasons to save but in a situation where the stakes are
       low.
     * Avoid money problems in the future – if you only start managing
       money when you’re an adult, the decisions you need to make usually
       involve bigger sums of money so the consequences of mistakes can be
       more severe.

   [211]Back to top

You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money

   You play the most important role in helping your child develop the
   skills they need to manage money. If they see you make money decisions,
   they’re more likely to come to you with their questions.

   Your child will also be influenced by other people in their lives who
   may deal with money in a different way to you, for example,
   grandparents or friends at school. Or they may see adverts or content
   on social media that could influence their attitude to money. This is a
   great opportunity to encourage your child to think about why people
   make different decisions about money.

What is money?

   Mr Orangutan holding up a coin

   Here’s an exercise to help you understand how children see money:
     * Imagine an alien is visiting earth for the first time.
     * What would they think money is for?
     * How would they think it is used?

   As an adult you know exactly what is happening. Children (like the
   alien) don’t understand what money is and how it is used unless it is
   explained to them.
   [212]Back to top

A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   It can be hard to know how to start a conversation about money, so it’s
   worth thinking about what you want to teach your child. This doesn’t
   have to be complicated — you could just decide the basic points you’d
   like to get across and the values or attitudes towards money you think
   are important to share.

   It’s also worth identifying what’s important to your family right now —
   it’s much more interesting for children to get involved in money
   decisions that affect them directly. For example, if you are saving up
   for a holiday you could show them some of things you’re cutting back on
   such as meals out or trips to the cinema.

Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

   Published on:

   26 April 2023

   The Money and Pensions Service has produced a new guide that shows
   creditors how to offer more support to customers living with a mental
   health problem. Living with a mental health problem can make it more
   difficult to interact with and manage money, including payments to
   financial services providers, public sector creditors and utility
   providers.

     * [62]Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

How the Mental Health and Money guide was created

   ‘Mental Health and Money’ was created after detailed consultation with
   experts in both financial wellbeing and mental health.

   The guidance is supported by the Money and Mental Health Policy
   Institute, Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and Citizens Advice, along with
   Adferiad Recovery in Wales, MindWise in Northern Ireland and Scottish
   organisations Change Mental Health and Citizens Advice Scotland.

Why money matters in mental health

   Money and mental health are strongly linked, with research from the
   Money and Mental Health Policy Institute showing one in five people
   (18%) living with a mental health problem are also in problem debt.

   However, we also know that there is a lot of information out there
   about what organisations should do to best support their customers, and
   it may be difficult to know where to start.
   [64]Back to top

What the guide offers

   The guide outlines six ways in which creditors in financial services,
   utilities and the public sector can do more to support those who are
   struggling.

   These include equipping staff to help, extra consideration when chasing
   payments and making it easier for people to get in touch when they need
   help.

   Others include allowing affected customers to involve third parties in
   managing their account, more forbearance and proactively referring them
   to external support.

   The guide also suggests how creditors can put the techniques into
   practice, lists resources they can use and reminds them of the relevant
   FCA duties that may require it.

What is money?

   24 November 2015 (updated on 20 June 2017)

   Euro banknotes and coins are money but so is the balance on a bank
   account. What actually is money? How is it created and what is the
   ECB’s role?
   [36]Tell me: What is a central bank?

The changing essence of money

   The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually
   commodity money – an object made of something that had a market value,
   such as a gold coin. Later on, representative money consisted of
   banknotes that could be swapped against a certain amount of gold or
   silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat
   money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a
   central bank but, unlike representative money, cannot be converted
   into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. It has no intrinsic value –
   the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless – yet is still
   accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the
   central bank to keep the value of money stable over time. If central
   banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money would lose its general
   acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store
   of value.

The nature of money over time

   Present-day currency can also exist independently of a physical
   representation. Money can exist in a bank account in the form of a
   computer entry or stored in the form of a savings account. Digital
   cash, or e-money, is monetary value stored in a pre-paid card or
   smartphone, for example. And direct debits, internet payments and card
   transfers are all forms of payment that do not involve cash. (There are
   even newer decentralised digital currencies or [37]virtual currency
   schemes like Bitcoin that exist without a central point of control like
   a central bank. These are not regarded as money from a legal
   perspective.)

   Despite the rapid rise in electronic payments, cash is still very
   popular. In the euro area, cash is used for a high proportion of all
   payments under €20. The value of euro cash is guaranteed by the ECB and
   the national central banks of the euro area countries, which together
   form the Eurosystem.

The uses of money and how the ECB keeps track of it

   Money, whatever its form, has three different functions. It is a medium
   of exchange – a means of payment with a value that everyone trusts.
   Money is also a unit of account allowing goods and services to be
   priced. And it is a store of value. Only a portion of euro cash in
   circulation actually circulates, i.e. is used for processing payments.
   For example, many of the circulating €50 notes are hoarded.

The functions of money

   Central banks usually define and monitor several monetary aggregates.
   Developments in these aggregates can reveal useful information about
   money and prices. Several aggregates are needed because many different
   financial assets are substitutable and the nature and characteristics
   of financial assets, transactions and means of payment change over
   time. The Eurosystem has defined a narrow (M1), an “intermediate” (M2)
   and a broad monetary aggregate (M3) for use in the ECB’s monetary
   analysis. The ECB looks at developments in these aggregates, together
   with a lot of other information and analyses, as part of its monetary
   policy strategy.

How is money created?

   The ECB acts as a bank for the commercial banks and this is also how it
   influences the flow of money and credit in the economy to achieve
   stable prices. Commercial banks, in turn, can borrow money, i.e.
   central bank reserves, from the ECB, usually to cover very short-term
   liquidity needs. The ECB’s main tool for controlling the quantity of
   “outside” money, and hence the demand for central bank reserves by
   commercial banks, is setting very short-term interest rates – the “cost
   of money”.

Money creation in the euro area

   Commercial banks can also create so-called “inside” money, i.e. bank
   deposits – this happens every time they issue a new loan. The
   difference between outside and inside money is that the former is an
   asset for the economy as a whole, but it is nobody’s liability. Inside
   money, on the other hand, is named this way because it is backed by
   private credit: if all the claims held by banks on private debtors were
   to be settled, the inside money created would be reversed to zero. So,
   it is one form of currency that is created – and can be reversed –
   within the private economy.

What about the ECB’s “money-printing” scheme I keep reading about?

   In practice, only the national central banks physically issue euro
   banknotes. “Money-printing” is the colloquial term for the ECB’s asset
   purchase programme, a form of “quantitative easing”. By purchasing
   assets in the financial market, the ECB creates additional central bank
   reserves that can help reduce – through a variety of channels – the
   interest rates faced by households and firms with a view to supporting
   the economy and, ultimately, to keep the value of money stable when the
   room to cut those interest rates directly controlled by the ECB is
   limited. In this process, the ECB does not actually print banknotes to
   pay for the assets but creates money electronically, which is credited
   to the seller or intermediary, e.g. a commercial bank. The seller can
   then use the additional liquidity to buy other assets or, in case of a

Shell posts $6.2bn profit as oil prices rise again

   Oil and gas giant Shell has posted strong profits helped by oil prices
   rising again.

   The energy giant reported earnings of $6.2bn (£5.1bn) between July and
   September, up sharply on the previous quarter.

   Profits were down from $9.4bn in the same period last year, however,
   when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a spike in oil and gas prices.

   Oil prices are currently lower than that period, but have risen
   recently.

   That is largely due to members of the Opec+ group of oil-producing
   nations cutting output to support the market.

   Earlier this week, the World Bank warned that the conflict in the
   Middle East could push the price of crude oil up to $150 a barrel -
   compared to $85 today.

   Shell said its earnings in the past three months were up 23% on the
   previous quarter.

   It said it had benefitted from higher oil prices and pumping more oil
   and gas, along with making more money from refining and gas trading.

   Oil prices surged in 2022 before falling back earlier this year,
   leading to lower profits at energy firms.

   However, the cost of crude oil has moved upwards again since the
   production cuts in the summer.

   Members of Opec+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, brought the cuts in
   due to concerns about weakening global demand.

   Moscow also blamed Western "interference with market dynamics",
   referring to the cap on Russian oil brought in following its invasion
   of Ukraine.

   It has already caused petrol prices to rise, hitting drivers at the
   pumps.

   Following its results, Shell announced a plan to return $3.5bn to
   shareholders through a share buyback programme. In total the firm will
   return $23bn to shareholders this year.

   Jonathan Noronha-Gant, of the climate campaign group Global Witness,
   criticised the payouts.

   "Shell's shareholders remain some of the biggest winners of Russia's
   brutal war in Ukraine and ongoing global instability," he said.

   "The turmoil in fossil fuel markets allows Shell to rake in enormous
   profits - but instead of investing in clean energy, the company has
   doubled down on oil, gas, and shareholder pay-outs."

   Greenpeace campaigner Charlie Kronick said: "People are sick of
   watching oil bosses feign concern about the planet while slashing jobs
   and investment in renewables and ploughing money into dividends, share
   buybacks, and new fossil fuel projects."

   Shell boss Wael Sawan, who took up his post in January, changed Shell's
   strategy to put more focus on oil and gas and announced plans to cut at
   least 15% of the workforce at its low-carbon solutions division.

   The firm declined to comment further.

   BBC News

   Tech billionaire Elon Musk has predicted that artificial intelligence
   will eventually mean that no one will have to work.

   He was speaking to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during an unusual "in
   conversation" event at the end of this week's summit on AI.

   The 50-minute interview included a prediction by Mr Musk that the tech
   will make paid work redundant.

   He also warned of humanoid robots that "can chase you anywhere".

   The pair talked about how London was a leading hub for the AI industry
   and how the technology could transform learning.

   But the chat took some darker turns too, with Mr Sunak recognising the
   "anxiety" people have about jobs being replaced, and the pair agreeing
   on the need for a "referee" to keep an eye on the super-computers of
   the future.

   Billionaire Elon Musk tells the British prime minister that AI will be
   smarter than the smartest human

   Tech investor and inventor Mr Musk has put money into AI firms and has
   employed the technology in his driverless Tesla cars - but he's also on
   the record about his fears it could threaten society and human
   existence itself.

   "There is a safety concern, especially with humanoid robots - at least
   a car can't chase you into a building or up a tree," he told the
   audience.

   Mr Sunak - who is keen to see investment in the UK's growing tech
   industry - replied: "You're not selling this."

   It's not every day you see the prime minister of a country interviewing
   a businessman like this, but Mr Sunak seemed happy to play host to his
   famous guest.

   And if he seemed like he was enjoying it, it should be no surprise - he
   previously lived in California, home to Silicon Valley, and his love of
   all things tech is well-documented.

   In a hall that size, Mr Musk was difficult to hear and mumbled through
   his elaborate musings about the future, but refrained from any
   off-the-cuff remarks that might have caused Downing Street
   embarrassment.

   The event was held in front of invited guests from the tech industry in
   a lavish hall in central London's Lancaster House.

   Unusually for an event involving the prime minister, TV cameras were
   not allowed inside, with Downing Street instead releasing their own
   footage.

   Some reporters were allowed to observe - but told they could not ask
   questions.

   The pair discussed the potential benefits of AI, with Mr Musk saying:
   "One of my sons has trouble making friends and an AI friend would be
   great for him."

   There was also agreement on the possibilities AI presents for young
   people's learning, with Mr Musk saying it could be "the best and most
   patient tutor".

   ‘Like having a very smart friend’: Musk on impact of AI

   But there was a stark warning on the potentially ruinous impact it
   could have on traditional jobs.

   "We are seeing the most disruptive force in history here," Mr Musk
   said, before speculating: "There will come a point where no job is
   needed - you can have a job if you want one for personal satisfaction
   but AI will do everything.

   "It's both good and bad - one of the challenges in the future will be
   how do we find meaning in life."

   Amid all the philosophising, there was little in the way of new
   announcements about how the technology will be employed and regulated
   in the UK - aside from the prime minister's promise that AI could be
   used to improve the government's own website.

   Mr Musk was one of the star guests at this week's summit - but it
   briefly looked like the event with Mr Sunak might be a little
   overshadowed.

   Hours before it was due to begin, Mr Musk took to his own website X,
   formerly known as Twitter, to take a swipe at the summit.

   As Mr Sunak was on his feet giving his final press conference at
   Bletchley Park, Mr Musk [67]shared a cartoon parodying an "AI Safety
   Summit".

   It depicted caricatures representing the UK, European Union, China and
   the US with speech bubbles reading "We declare that AI posses a
   potentially catastrophic risk to humankind" - while their thought
   bubbles read "And I cannot wait to develop it first".

   But in the end, the pair appeared at ease together, and Mr Sunak in
   particular looked in his element - perhaps even slightly bowled over by
   the controversial billionaire, who he called a "brilliant innovator and
   technologist".

   From the cheap seats behind the dignitaries of the tech world, it was
   hard to put your finger on who was really the powerful one out of this
   pair.

   Was it Mr Sunak as he asked the celeb tech billionaire questions? Or
   was it Mr Musk, who did much of the talking?

   Either way, both men hope to have a say in whatever our AI future has
   in store for us.

EUROPEAN MONEY WEEK

All around Europe

20-25 March 2023

WHAT IS EUROPEAN MONEY WEEK?

   Starting on Monday 20 March 2023, European Money Week will celebrate
   financial education and raise awareness about money and personal
   finances. Throughout this week, many financial education events will be
   organized across Europe by national banking associations and the
   European Banking Federation.

   European Money Week is an annual initiative, aligned with OECD’s
   [32]Global Money Week. It involves young people in more than 35
   European countries, with activities ranging from classroom teaching
   sessions, seminars and conferences and of course the [33]European Money
   Quiz. All activities seek to improve financial literacy through better
   financial education. European Money Week is an integral part of EBF’s
   mission to promote financial literacy in Europe through events,
   publications and partnerships.

EUROPEAN MONEY QUIZ

   The European Money Quiz is a new initiative for 13-15-year-olds.
   Teenagers across 28 European countries play against each other. First,
   there will be a national selection between classrooms, with a live quiz
   where thousands of classrooms can directly play against each other. In
   most countries, these contests will be played in March, during or
   around European Money Week. Then, the winners of these national
   selections will be invited to travel to Brussels for the European Money
   Quiz finals.

GLOBAL MONEY WEEK

   European Money Week has been planned to coincide with Global Money
   Week. This annual initiative is developed and organized by the OECD

Financial counselling

   Free help to sort out your money problems

   Page reading time: 2 minutes
   (BUTTON) On this page

   Financial counselling is a free and confidential service offered by
   not-for-profit community organisations.

   Financial counsellors do not offer legal advice. If you’re facing legal
   action, get [276]free legal advice straight away.

What financial counsellors do

   Financial counsellors are skilled professionals who provide advice and
   support to people struggling with bills and debt. A financial
   counsellor can:
     * assess your financial situation
     * provide advice about what to do if you're struggling to pay bills
       and fines
     * help you negotiate with government agencies, your landlord,
       utilities, telcos, and other creditors
     * assist you if you're being harassed by [277]debt collectors
     * refer you to other services you might need, such as legal,
       accommodation, health and crisis services

   Read more about [278]what financial counsellors do.

   Never pay for financial counselling. Businesses that charge fees for
   this are [279]debt consolidation and refinancing companies.

   as possible. If you get help early, you will have many more options.

Get help with the cost of living

   This advice applies to England. See advice for [24]See advice for
   Northern Ireland, [25]See advice for Scotland, [26]See advice for Wales

   If you don’t have enough money to live on, you might be able to get
   help to afford essentials like bills and food. This includes the
   Household Support Fund and cost of living payments.

   You should check if you can claim benefits - you might be able to do
   this even if you work, have savings or own a home.

If you owe money and you're struggling to pay

   You should speak to the organisations you owe money to – they might let
   you pay smaller amounts or take a break from payments.

   Don’t ignore bills or letters about money you owe.

   You can [27]find out how to start dealing with your debts.

Check what benefits you can get

   Lots of people miss out on benefits they’re entitled to - so it’s worth
   checking what you can get.

   Claiming benefits might also let you get access to other financial help
   like cost of living payments and discounts on energy and transport.

   You might be able to claim benefits or increase your current benefits
   if you’re:
     * over 16 years old with a low income or no income
     * sick or disabled, including if you have a mental health condition
     * of State Pension age with a low income or no income
     * a carer
     * responsible for children

   [28]Check what benefits you can get.

Get your first benefit payment early

   When you apply for benefits, you might be able to get your first
   payment early while you’re waiting for either:
     * a decision on your application
     * your first payment

   This is called a 'short-term benefit advance'. You can get an advance
   for:
     * Universal Credit
     * Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
     * Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
     * Carer’s Allowance
     * Pension Credit
     * State Pension

   You’ll need to pay back the advance. The Department for Work and
   Pensions (DWP) will take an amount off your future payments until
   you've paid it back. For Universal Credit, you can spread the
   repayments over 24 months. For other benefits, you’ll usually repay
   your advance over 12 weeks.

   If you've applied for Universal Credit, you can [29]check how to get a
   Universal Credit advance payment.

   If you’ve applied for a different benefit, contact the benefits office
   that's dealing with your claim. You can find their contact details on
   any letter or email you’ve had from them.

Check if you'll get a Cost of Living Payment

   The government will send you a 'Cost of Living Payment' if you:
     * get a benefit based on your income - for example, Universal Credit,
       Pension Credit, or tax credits
     * get a disability benefit - for example, Personal Independence
       Payment
     * are over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments

   You’ll get 1 Cost of Living Payment for each type of benefit you get.
   For example, if you get Universal Credit, Personal Independence
   Payment, and Winter Fuel Payments, you’ll get 3 Cost of Living
   Payments.

   If you’re not claiming benefits yet, you should [30]check if you can
   claim benefits. It's worth starting a claim as soon as possible if
   you're eligible - this means you might be able to get Cost of Living
   Payments in the future.

If you get benefits based on your income

   If you’re eligible, the government will send you a payment of £300 in
   autumn 2023 - you'll get this by 19 November.

   To get the £300 payment you must have:
     * been entitled to a benefits payment on any day from 18 August to 17
       September 2023
     * started a successful claim for Universal Credit by 18 August
     * started a successful claim for another income-based benefit by 17
       September 2023

   The government will send you another payment of £299 during spring 2024
   if you’re still eligible.

   The government have already given 3 Cost of Living Payments to people
   who get certain benefits.

If you didn't get the last Cost of Living Payment

   You should have got a payment of £301 by 17 May 2023 if you get any of
   the following benefits:
     * Universal Credit
     * Pension Credit
     * Working Tax Credit
     * Child Tax Credit
     * income-based Jobseekers Allowance
     * income-related Employment and Support Allowance
     * Income Support

   You’ll have only got one £301 payment - even if you get more than 1 of
   these benefits.

   To get the latest payment you must have either:
     * received a benefits payment at any point between 5 April and 17 May
       2023
     * started a successful benefit claim between 5 April and 17 May 2023

   If you’re waiting for a decision on your benefits claim, you won’t get
   the Cost of Living Payment until your claim is successful.

   If your benefits are paid to someone else, like your landlord, you
   should still have got the Cost of Living Payment.

   If you think you should have received a Cost of Living Payment, you
   can [31]report a missing payment on GOV.UK.

If you get a disability benefit

   The government gave a £150 Cost of Living Payment to people getting
   disability benefits between 20 June and 4 July 2023.

   You would have been eligible for this one-off payment if you get any of
   the following benefits:
     * Disability Living Allowance
     * Personal Independence Payment
     * Attendance Allowance
     * Armed Forces Independence Payment
     * Constant Attendance Allowance
     * War Pension Mobility Supplement

   To get this payment you must have:
     * been getting one of these benefits on 1 April 2023
     * applied for one of these benefits by 1 April 2023 - you won't get
       the payment until your claim is successful

If you haven't received a previous Cost of Living Payment

   If you think you should have received a Cost of Living Payment, you
   can [32]report a missing payment on GOV.UK.

If you're over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments

   You'll either get a £300 or £150 Cost of Living Payment, depending on
   your situation. You'll get this at the same time as your usual Winter
   Fuel Payment from November 2023.

   You’ll get a £300 Cost of Living Payment if you live either:
     * on your own
     * with people who don’t qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment

   If you live with someone else who qualifies for the Winter Fuel
   Payment, the amount you’ll get depends on whether either of you get any
   of the following:
     * Pension Credit
     * income-related Employment Support Allowance
     * income-based Jobseeker's Allowance

   If either you or the person you live with gets one of these benefits,
   you’ll both get £300 - as long as you’re not partners. If you’re
   partners, you’ll only get one £300 payment.

   If neither of you gets one of these benefits, you’ll both get £150.

   If you live in residential care and qualify for the Winter Fuel
   Payment, you'll get £150 unless you get any of these benefits.

Check if you need to apply for Winter Fuel Payments

   You're usually entitled to Winter Fuel Payments if you’re of State
   Pension age in the third week of September. The State Pension age is
   66.

   You should start getting the Winter Fuel Payment automatically once you
   reach State Pension age. You might need to apply if you're in one of
   these situations:
     * you don't get State Pension
     * you don't get another benefit
     * you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein

   You can [33]find out how to apply for the Winter Fuel Payment on
   GOV.UK.

Get help with your energy bills

   If you’re struggling to pay your energy bills or top up your prepayment
   meter, you might be able to get help - for example a fuel voucher or a
   grant from your energy supplier.

   [34]Check if you can get help to pay your energy bills.

   You might be able to save money on your energy bills by switching to a
   different supplier, or to a different tariff with your current
   supplier. [35]Check if you can switch.

Check how to make your home more energy efficient

   If your home is energy efficient, you’ll pay less to heat your home and
   it will stay warm for longer.

   It’s a good idea to look into making your home more energy efficient at
   any time of the year. This is because it can take a few months to sort
   things out - for example, to find someone who can do the work.

   You might be able to apply for help with the cost of:
     * a new boiler
     * boiler repairs
     * loft or cavity wall insulation
     * a heat pump

   Check if you can [36]get help with the cost of energy efficiency.

If you need somewhere to stay warm

   You can ask your local council if they have information about nearby
   ‘warm spaces’. These are public places that anyone can use to stay warm
   - for example a community space like a library. You can [37]find out
   how to contact your local council on GOV.UK.

Get help with essential costs

   Your local council might help you pay for things like:
     * your energy and water bills
     * food
     * essential items - for example, clothes or an oven

   This help is known as 'welfare assistance' or the ‘Household Support
   Fund’. Each council runs their own scheme. You’ll need to check if you
   can get support and what type of support you can get.

   Ask your local council if they run a welfare assistance or Household
   Support Fund scheme. You can [38]find out how to contact your local
   council on GOV.UK.

   You don’t have to be getting benefits to get help from your local
   council. If you do get benefits, they won’t be affected if you start
   getting money from a welfare assistance or Household Support Fund
   scheme.

   There are also other things you can do if you’re struggling to afford
   essentials like rent or food.

Get help paying for rent, council tax and other bills

   There are things you can do if you’re struggling to pay your rent and
   bills.

   You can [39]check what help and support you can get with your rent and
   bills.

   referral to a food bank.

   You can [40]find out how to get help from a food bank.

If you have a child or are pregnant

   You might be able to get a Healthy Start card to help you buy certain
   types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.

   To get the Healthy Start card you must be at least 10 weeks pregnant or
   have a child under 4 years old. You must also be getting either:
     * Universal Credit - but only if your household earns £408 a month or
       less
     * Income Support
     * income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
     * income-related Employment and Support Allowance - but only if
       you're pregnant
     * Pension Credit
     * Child Tax Credit - but only if your household earns £16,190 a year
       or less

   If you get Child Tax Credit, you can’t get the card if you also get
   Working Tax Credit - unless you get the ‘run-on’ payment. Working Tax
   Credit run-on is the payment you get for 4 weeks after you stop
   qualifying for Working Tax Credit.

   With the Healthy Start card you’ll get:
     * £4.25 each week from week 10 of your pregnancy
     * £8.50 each week for children from birth to 1 year old
     * £4.25 each week for children between 1 and 4 years old
     * free vitamins

   You can [41]apply for the Healthy Start scheme on the NHS website.

Get help with health costs

   You might be able to get help paying for NHS charges, for example:
     * prescriptions
     * dental treatment
     * sight tests, glasses and contact lenses
     * travel to NHS treatment

   [42]Check if you can get help with health costs on the NHS website.

If you pay for regular prescriptions

   If you can’t get help to pay for your prescriptions, you might be able
   to save money by buying a prepayment certificate.

   You’ll pay a fixed price for either 3 or 12 months. This will cover the
   cost of all the prescriptions you need during that time.

   You can buy a prepayment certificate for unlimited prescriptions for:
     * £31.25 for 3 months
     * £111.60 for 12 months - you can pay this in 10 instalments of
       £11.16

   You can [43]buy a prepayment certificate on the NHS website.

If you’ve been prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

   If you already have a prepayment certificate for other medicines, it
   covers the cost of your HRT.

   If you only need a certificate for HRT, you might be able to save
   money. You can get an HRT prescription prepayment certificate -  it
   costs £19.30 for 12 months.

   The certificate only covers certain HRT medicines. [44]Check if your
   HRT medicine is covered on the NHS website. If you have HRT medicines
   that aren’t covered, you’ll have to pay for them or buy a normal
   prepayment certificate.

   You can [45]buy an HRT prescription prepayment certificate on the NHS
   website.

Get help with your energy and water if you're disabled

   If you're disabled, you might be able to get extra support with your
   energy and water. You can [46]check how to get free advice about energy
   and water bills on the Scope website.

Get help if you have children or are pregnant

   You might be able to get help if:
     * your child is at school
     * your child is in childcare
     * you’re pregnant or you’ve recently had a baby

If your child is at school

   If you’re on a low income or claim certain benefits, you might be able

   For example, you could get:
     * free school meals
     * free transport to school
     * a grant to help to buy school clothes or uniforms
     * help with school trips

   [47]Find out more about getting help with school costs.

If your child is in childcare

   to get help with childcare costs. For example:
     * if you work and claim Universal Credit, you might be able to claim
       back up to 85% of your childcare costs - you could get up to
       £950.92 a month for 1 child under 17 or £1,630.15 for 2 or more
       children
     * if you have a 2 year old, you might be able to claim up to 15 hours
       of free childcare a week

     * £4,000 a year for each disabled child under 17

   You won’t be able to receive Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit,
   Universal Credit or childcare vouchers if you get Tax-Free Childcare.
   Work out which option is best for you before applying.

   If you have a 3 or 4 year old, you can get up to 570 free hours of
   early education or childcare a year. If you work, you might be able to
   claim more.

   [48]Check what help you’re eligible for on the UK government’s
   Childcare Choices website.

If you’re pregnant or have a baby

   You could get a one-off payment of £500 to help towards the costs of
   having a baby. You usually qualify if you get certain benefits and are
   having your first baby - you have to claim before your baby is 6 months
   old. [49]Find out how to apply for a Sure Start Maternity Grant on
   GOV.UK.

   You might be able to get support from a local baby bank - these offer
   free essentials like nappies, toys, shoes and clothes.

   your midwife or health visitor.

   [50]Find out more about maternity pay and parental rights.

Get help with travel costs

   Contact your local council to check if they offer free or discounted
   travel - for example, if you’re:
     * in education
     * on a work placement
     * unemployed and looking for work
     * a veteran

   You can [51]find your local council on GOV.UK.

   payment options - like reducing the bill or setting up a payment plan.

   If you can’t set up an affordable payment plan, you should [58]get debt
   advice. Your vet might decide to stop treating your pet if you owe
   money.

     * where you might be able to cut costs

If you’re over 55 and have a personal pension

   You might be able to take some money from your pension savings to help
   pay for essential costs or to pay off your debts.

   You should think about whether taking money from your pension is the
   best financial decision for you. Taking money from your pension will
   mean you have less income when you retire. If you’re getting benefits,
   taking money from your pension could affect your claim.

   You can [61]get free guidance on your pension options from Pension
   Wise. They’ll explain the different options so you can decide which is
   best for you.

   You should also get financial advice before taking any money from your
   pension savings - you’ll have to pay.

   You can [62]check how to find a financial adviser - they can tell you
   which option is best for you.

   health.

   Money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people for
   the payment of goods and services, as well as the repayment of loans.
   Money makes the world go 'round. Economies rely on money to facilitate
   transactions and to power financial growth. Typically, it is economists
   who define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. Here are
   the multifaceted characteristics of money.

Key Takeaways

     * Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people and businesses to
       obtain what they need to live and thrive.
     * Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods
       before money was created.
     * Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for
       most people it represents something valuable.
     * Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a
       physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government.
     * Above all, money is a unit of account - a socially accepted
       standard unit with which things are priced.

Medium of Exchange

   Before the development of a [167]medium of exchange—that is,
   money—people would barter to obtain the goods and services they needed.
   Two individuals, each possessing some goods the other wanted, would
   enter into an agreement to trade.

   Early forms of bartering, however, do not provide the transferability
   and divisibility that makes trading efficient. For instance, if someone
   has cows but needs bananas, they must find someone who not only has
   bananas but also the desire for meat. What if that individual finds
   someone who has the need for meat but no bananas and can only offer
   potatoes? To get meat, that person must find someone who has bananas
   and wants potatoes, and so on.

   The lack of transferability of bartering for goods is tiring,
   confusing, and inefficient. But that is not where the problems end;
   even if the person finds someone with whom to trade meat for bananas,
   they may not consider a bunch of bananas to be worth a whole cow. Such
   a trade requires coming to an agreement and devising a way to determine
   how many bananas are worth certain parts of the cow.

   [168]Commodity money solved these problems. Commodity money is a type
   of good that functions as currency. In the 17th and early 18th
   centuries, for example, American colonists used beaver pelts and dried
   corn in transactions. Possessing generally accepted values, these
   commodities were used to buy and sell other things. The commodities
   used for trade had certain characteristics: they were widely desired
   and, therefore, valuable, but they were also durable, portable, and
   easily stored.

   Another, more advanced example of commodity money is a precious metal
   such as gold. For centuries, gold was used to back paper currency—up
   until the 1970s. In the case of the U.S. dollar, for example, this
   meant that foreign governments were able to take their dollars and
   exchange them at a specified rate for gold with the U.S. Federal
   Reserve. What's interesting is that, unlike the beaver pelts and dried
   corn (which can be used for clothing and food, respectively), gold is
   precious purely because people want it. It is not necessarily
   useful—you can't eat gold, and it won't keep you warm at night, but the
   majority of people think it is beautiful, and they know others think it
   is beautiful. So, gold is something that has worth. Gold, therefore,
   serves as a physical token of wealth based on people's perceptions.

   This relationship between money and gold provides insight into how
   money gains its value—as a representation of something valuable.

Impressions Create Everything

   The second type of money is [169]fiat money, which does not require
   backing by a physical commodity. Instead, the value of fiat currencies
   is set by supply and demand and people's faith in its worth. Fiat money
   developed because gold was a scarce resource, and rapidly growing
   economies growing couldn't always mine enough to back their currency
   supply requirements. For a booming economy, the need for gold to give
   money value is extremely inefficient, especially when its value is
   really created by people's perceptions.

   Fiat money becomes the token of people's perception of worth, the basis
   for why money is created. An economy that is growing is apparently
   succeeding in producing other things that are valuable to itself and
   other economies. The stronger the economy, the stronger its money will
   be perceived (and sought after) and vice versa. However, people's
   perceptions must be supported by an economy that can produce the
   products and services that people want.

   For example, beginning in 1971, the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold
   standard—the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold, and the price of
   gold was no longer fixed to any dollar amount. This was made official
   in 1976. This meant that it was now possible to create more paper money
   than there was gold to back it; the health of the U.S. economy backed
   the dollar's value. If the economy stalls, the value of the U.S. dollar
   will drop both domestically through inflation and internationally
   through currency exchange rates. The implosion of the U.S. economy
   would plunge the world into a financial dark age, so many other
   countries and entities are working tirelessly to ensure that never
   happens.

   Today, the value of money (not just the dollar, but most currencies) is
   decided purely by its [170]purchasing power, as dictated by inflation.
   That is why simply printing new money will not create wealth for a
   country. Money is created by a kind of a perpetual interaction between
   real, tangible things, our desire for them, and our abstract faith in
   what has value. Money is valuable because we want it, but we want it
   only because it can get us a desired product or service.

How Is Money Measured?

   But exactly how much money is out there, and what forms does it take?
   Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there
   is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so
   that it is more discernible for measurement purposes:
     * [171]M1 – This category of money includes all physical
       denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are
       checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers' checks. It also
       includes other forms of liquid deposits and assets such as savings
       accounts. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and
       is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments (see
       the "active money" section below).
     * [172]M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money
       found in M1 to all time-related deposits, many types of retirement
       accounts, and non-institutional money market funds. This category
       represents money that can be readily transferred into cash.
     * [173]M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found
       in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits,
       institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements,
       along with other larger liquid assets. M3 indicates a country's
       money supply or the total amount of money within an economy.

Active Money

   The M1 category includes what's known as active money—the total value
   of coins and paper currency in circulation as well as liquid deposits
   and accounts. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally,
   monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, [174]Federal Reserve
   Banks distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks
   lend money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is
   actively circulated.

   The variable demand for cash equates to a constantly fluctuating active
   money total. For example, people typically cash paychecks or withdraw
   from ATMs over the weekend, so there is more active cash on a Monday
   than on a Friday. The public demand for cash declines at certain
   times—following the December holiday season, for example.

How Money Is Created

   We have discussed why and how money, a representation of perceived
   value, is created in the economy, but another important factor
   concerning money and the economy is how a country's central bank (the
   central bank in the United States is the Federal Reserve or the Fed)
   can influence and manipulate the money supply.

   If the Fed wants to increase the amount of money in circulation,
   perhaps to boost economic activity, the central bank can, of course,
   print it. However, the physical bills are only a small part of the
   money supply.

   Another way for the central bank to increase the money supply is to buy
   government fixed-income securities in the market. When the central bank
   buys these government securities, it puts money into the marketplace,
   and effectively into the hands of the public. How does a central bank
   such as the Fed pay for this? As strange as it sounds, the central bank
   simply creates the money and transfers it to those selling the
   securities. Alternatively, the Fed can lower [175]interest rates
   allowing banks to extend low-cost loans or credit—a phenomenon known as
   cheap money—and encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow and
   spend.

   To shrink the money supply, perhaps to reduce inflation, the central
   bank does the opposite and sells government securities. The money with
   which the buyer pays the central bank is essentially taken out of
   circulation. Keep in mind that we are generalizing in this example to
   keep things simple.

   A central bank cannot print money without end. If too much money is
   issued, the value of that currency will drop consistent with the law of
   supply and demand.

   Remember, as long as people have faith in the currency, a central bank
   can issue more of it. But if the Fed issues too much money, the value
   will go down, as with anything that has a higher supply than demand.
   Therefore, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants.

The History of American Money

Currency Wars

   In the 17th century, Great Britain was determined to keep control of
   both the American colonies and the natural resources they controlled.
   To do this, the British limited the money supply and made it illegal
   for the colonies to mint coins of their own. Instead, the colonies were
   forced to trade using English bills of exchange that could only be
   redeemed for English goods. Colonists were paid for their goods with
   these same bills, effectively cutting them off from trading with other
   countries.

   In response, the colonies regressed to a barter system using
   ammunition, tobacco, nails, pelts, and anything else that could be
   traded. Colonists also gathered whatever foreign currencies they could,
   the most popular being the large, silver Spanish dollars. These were
   called pieces of eight because, when you had to make change, you pulled
   out your knife and hacked it into eight bits. From this, we have the
   expression "two bits," meaning a quarter of a dollar.

Massachusetts Money

   Massachusetts was the first colony to defy the mother country. In 1652,
   the state minted its own silver coins including the Oak Tree and Pine
   Tree shillings. The state circumvented the British law stating that
   only the monarch of the British empire could issue coins by dating all
   their coins in 1652, a period when there was no monarch. In 1690,
   Massachusetts also issued the first paper money calling it bills of
   credit.

   Tensions between America and Britain continued to mount until the
   Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. The colonial leaders declared
   independence and created a new currency called [176]Continentals to
   finance their side of the war. Unfortunately, each government printed
   as much money as it needed without backing it to any standard or asset,
   so the Continentals experienced rapid inflation and became worthless.
   This experience discouraged the American government from using paper
   money for almost a century.

Aftermath of the Revolution

   The chaos from the Revolutionary War left the new nation's monetary
   system a complete wreck. Most of the currencies in the newly formed
   United States of America were useless. The problem wasn't resolved
   until 13 years later in 1788 when Congress was granted constitutional
   powers to coin money and regulate its value. In 1792, the Coinage Act
   was passed establishing the first national mint which created a
   national monetary system and unit of money, the dollar. There was also
   a bimetallic standard, meaning that both silver and gold could be
   valued in and used to back paper dollars.

   It took years to get all the foreign coins as well as competing state
   and local bank currencies out of circulation. Banks issued their own
   notes during this time period, which was technically illegal as only
   Congress and the federal government had this power. Most of these banks
   issued more notes than they had coin to cover, as a result these notes
   often traded at less than face value.

   In the 1860s, the U.S. government created $450 million in legal tender
   to finance its battle against the Confederacy in the American Civil
   War. These were called [177]greenbacks because their backs were printed
   in green. The government-backed this currency and stated that it could
   be used to pay back both public and private debts. The value did,
   however, fluctuate according to the North's success or failure at
   certain stages in the war.

   Confederate dollars, issued by the seceding states during the 1860s,
   followed the fate of the Confederacy and were worthless by the end of
   the war.

Aftermath of the Civil War

   In February 1863, the U.S. Congress passed the National Bank Act. This
   act established a monetary system whereby national banks issued notes
   backed by U.S. government bonds. The U.S. Treasury then worked to get
   state bank notes out of circulation so that the national bank notes
   would become the only currency.

   During this period of rebuilding, there was debate over the bimetallic
   standard. Some advocated using just silver to back the dollar, others
   advocated for gold. The situation was resolved in 1900 when the
   [178]Gold Standard Act was passed, which made gold the sole backing for
   the dollar. This backing meant that, in theory, you could take your
   paper money and exchange it for the corresponding value in gold. In
   1913, the Federal Reserve was created and given the power to steer the
   economy by controlling the money supply and interest rates on loans.

The Bottom Line

   Money has changed substantially since the days of shells and skins, but
   its main function hasn't changed at all. Regardless of what form it
   takes, money offers us a medium of exchange for goods and services and
   allows the economy to grow as transactions can be completed at greater
   speeds.

White House says money for Ukraine military aid is running out with Congress
divided on whether to provide more

   CNN  —

   The White House made clear Friday that the amount of money the US has
   available for [140]Ukraine military aid is quickly running out as House
   Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate remain at odds over the Biden
   administration’s multi-billion dollar request for more funding.

   A $425 million security package announced on Friday pushed the US to
   the limit on the money available to Kiev.

   “We are beginning to provide Ukraine with smaller [Presidential
   Drawdown Authority] packages in order to stretch out our ability to
   support Ukraine for as long as possible,” White House Press Secretary
   Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.

   Last month, President Joe Biden requested more than $100 billion for
   national security, including $61.4 billion for Ukraine and $14.3
   billion for Israel, urging Congress to pass the supplemental bill as a
   “comprehensive, bipartisan agreement.”

   The administration’s request includes $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine
   and $14.3 billion in aid for Israel, $9.15 billion in funding for
   humanitarian aid, $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the
   Indo-Pacific region and $13.6 billion to address security at the
   US-Mexico border.

   But the newly elected GOP speaker has yet to outline his plan for
   Ukraine funding after decoupling the request from Israel aid,
   [141]which the House passed Thursday.

   “Ukraine will come in short order, it will come next,” Johnson said at
   a press conference Thursday, linking it to a need for stricter border
   security policies which will be far harder to pass in the
   Democratic-led Senate. “If we’re going to take care of a border in
   Ukraine, we need to take care of America’s border as well.”

   The most recent package included $125 million from a presidential
   drawdown, which is equipment and weaponry pulled directly from Defense
   Department stocks and quickly shipped to Ukraine. But it is one of the
   smallest drawdown packages given to Ukraine since the start of the war
   more than 18 months ago, as the White House acknowledged it needed to
   stretch what little funding it had left.

   The package also included $300 million under the Ukraine Security
   Assistance Initiative (USAI), which exhausted the funding for that
   authority. Under USAI, the government contracts with industry to
   provide equipment to Ukraine, intending it as a longer-term transfer of
   supplies to Kyiv.

   The Pentagon’s Chief Financial Officer, Michael McCord, warned in early
   October that USAI money had run out for the previous fiscal year,
   urging Congress to pass additional funding.  The $300 million was the
   only money available for USAI from the current Continuing Resolution
   funding the government.

help, says CFP

   Americans don't seem particularly eager to boost contributions to their
   [36]emergency funds. More than 4 in 5 say they did not increase
   emergency savings this year, [37]according to a recent survey from
   Bankrate, and 60% say they feel behind when it comes to saving for a
   rainy day.

   Can you blame them?

   After all, it's hard to be pumped about putting money away for a
   situation you hope will never actually arise. That's why, for people
   looking to bump up their savings, a change in mental accounting might
   be in order.

   "Everyone has their own version of what a rainy day means to them, but
   it always has that negative connotation," says Spenser Liszt, a
   certified financial planner and founder of Motif Planning. "With a
   topic that's so vulnerable, like money, it's important to encourage
   positive language so people can have positive experiences with their
   money."

   That's why, in addition to your traditional emergency fund, some
   financial pros recommend building a so-called sunny day fund of money
   you can spend guilt-free or put toward exciting opportunities.

   Here's how they say it could work.

Yes, you still need an emergency fund

   On your list of financial priorities, which may include goals such as
   saving for retirement and paying down debt, building an emergency fund
   should likely occupy the top spot, financial pros say.

   Without savings in place, a financial emergency, such as a job loss or
   a surprise medical bill, could force you to sell your investments or
   delve deeper into debt to make up the difference, essentially derailing
   your financial plan.

   Traditionally, financial planners recommend [38]stashing three to six
   months' worth of living expenses in a safe, cash vehicle, such as a
   high-yield savings account, in case of emergencies. (Check out [39]this
   list of the best high-yield savings accounts from CNBC Select.)

   But that's easier said than done. Less than half — 48% — of U.S. adults
   say they could cover three months' worth of expenses, [40]according to
   Bankrate.

   If you're having trouble getting up to that number, don't beat yourself
   up. Instead, "celebrate milestones along the way," says Andy Baxley, a
   CFP and senior planner at The Planning Center. "If you're aiming for
   six months and you don't have anything, you should be celebrating when
   you get to one month of savings."

   What's more, consider the sorts of expenses your emergency fund could
   potentially cover to give yourself some piece of mind. "If you have
   insurance deductibles, it can be good to have those ready in cash for
   auto, home or any other insurance policies you might have," says Liszt.
   "Another would be cash to cover living expenses during the disability
   waiting period, or elimination period."

   Ideally, you'd have enough cash to cover every contingency, but the
   little wins you can give yourself on the way matter, too.

How a 'sunny day' fund can help you reach your goals

   Much of financial planning is about setting money aside for defined
   goals, such as retirement. But other opportunities for your money will
   inevitably arise. And when they do, a sunny day fund could come in
   handy.

   What that looks like is up to you. Perhaps you want money on hand for
   short-term things that come up — say, an impromptu vacation with
   friends or a fun business opportunity. In that case, keep your sunny
   day fund in an income-producing cash account, the same way you would an
   emergency fund.

   If you want to save for something bigger and more amorphous — say you
   want a lavish anniversary celebration or plan to eventually take a
   yearlong sabbatical from work to write a novel — favor a taxable
   brokerage account. That will allow you to invest the money in assets
   that will ostensibly grow, but also withdraw funds whenever you need
   them without penalty.

   Setting up such a fund serves a twofold purpose. Not only are you
   saving for something you actually want, but you're also keeping
   yourself from tapping into your emergency fund for non-emergencies.

   "People put their nose to the grindstone and save in their emergency
   fund, but then the opportunity to go to your best friend's wedding in
   Greece comes up, and it's like, 'Well, maybe I'll do that,'" says
   Baxley.

   He recommends earmarking a certain percentage of your emergency savings
   each month toward your sunny day fund. And in the event that the rainy
   day comes sooner than you think, you can always tap your sunny day fund
   now and rebuild it later.

   "That money is fungible," Baxley says. "You can move money over from
   your sunny day fund to your emergency fund instantaneously these days."

What is 'Money'

   Money
   The money came into existence to overcome the drawbacks of the barter
   system. Earlier, people use to exchange goods and services as a form of
   commerce. This often led to many disadvantages, one of which was the
   double coincidence of wants. To solve this problem, a standard medium
   of exchange, money, was introduced.
   What is money?
   A medium of exchange that is centralized, generally accepted,
   recognized, and facilitates transactions of goods and services, is
   known as money.
     * Money is a medium of exchange for various goods and services in an
       economy.
     * The money system varies with the governments and countries.
     * Different countries have different currencies.
     * The central authority is responsible for monitoring the monetary
       system.
     * There are many forms of money, and cryptocurrency is the newest
       addition to the forms of money and can be internationally
       exchanged.

   Characteristics of Money
   Fungible currency: A currency must be fungible which means that the
   units used as a currency must be equal in quality and shall be
   interchangeable. A non-fungible form of currency is not considered
   reliable for transactions.
   Durable: A good currency is durable enough to be used more than just
   one time. It should not be perishable. A perishable good or article
   should not be used as a currency because it cannot be used multiple
   times and also cannot be stored for future transactions. Therefore, to
   conserve the future-oriented use-value of the money, a currency must be
   durable.
   Easily recognizable: The users of the money must be ascertained of its
   authenticity. In other words, the currency must be universally
   recognized. An unrecognized currency or money leads to disagreement
   with the exchange terms. A recognized currency ensures trust in the
   money system as well as its acceptance.
   Stability: A currency must be stable in terms of value. In simple
   terms, money should have a constant or increasing value. Money cannot
   be unstable whose value keeps drastically changing. An unstable
   currency can give room to the risk of a sudden drop in value which can
   hamper the acceptance and authenticity of the money system.
   Portable: A currency must be portable and can be conveniently
   transported from one place to another. The money must be divisible into
   various quantities making its use better. Money if not portable can
   lead to an exceeded cost of transportation of the currency itself.
   Therefore, money should be able to be divided into further smaller
   units to facilitate smooth transactions of various quantities of goods.
   Secondly, it should be easily transferable and portable.
   Functions of Money
   Medium of exchange: Money is the generally accepted medium of exchange
   that is used to make all the transactions. Ex- payments of goods,
   payment of tax, etc.
   A measure of Value: Money expresses the value of every service as well
   as goods. Therefore, it is a common denomination.
   Standard of deferred payments: Money is considered the standard for
   future payments. Ex- The payment of the electricity bill on the
   upcoming due date.
   Store of value: It means that money is capable of being stored and
   transferring the purchasing power from today to the future. Ex: Using
   the money in a savings account to buy new furniture.
   Distribution of social income: Income can easily be distributed with
   the help of money. Ex: Distribution of total money earned by a school
   in the form of salaries, wages, utility bills, etc.
   Basis of Credit Creation: The "store of value" function of the money
   helps in credit creation by the banks. Ex: Using the money of demand
   deposits as a tool for credit creation.
   Liquidity: Money is the most liquid asset of the economy. Ex: Credit
   cards, debit cards, cash.
   Types of Money:
   The following are the types of money:
   Market Determined Money: Any good that can be generally accepted by the
   people of the economy to exchange it indirectly for various goods and
   services between different parties is called Market determined money.
   Fiat Money and Legal Tender: The form of money that is issued by the
   government and is not backed by any commodity is known as fiat money.
   Ex: INR, Dollar, Pounds, etc. The term legal tender states the money
   that is legally issued by the government. Ex: Coins and Banknotes.
   Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies are an electronic medium of exchange
   that exists virtually. Crypto is a peer-to-peer system that runs on the
   blockchain. In simple terms, it is an intangible form of currency and
   has opportunities for international exchange.
   What is the functional definition of money?
   The functional definition of money states that the money should be
   capable of bringing a generally accepted medium of exchange, the
   measure of value, the standard of deferred payment, and a store of
   value.
   How many functions of money are there?
   There are three functions of money: Primary, secondary, and other
   functions.
   What is Convertible Virtual Currency?
   Convertible virtual Currency is used as a substitute for the legal
   money accepted in the economy. These currencies can easily be exchanged
   for fiat money like cryptocurrencies.

   Borrowing gives you the flexibility to realise your dreams sooner than
   you otherwise could- whether that's buying a home or investment
   property, or applying for another type of credit product or service.

   Most of us will apply for a loan at some stage in our lives, and if all
   goes to plan, your application will be approved - giving you the money
   you need, when you need it.

   The type of loan you apply for will depend on what you're buying. For
   example, you'll need an owner occupied home loan to buy a property for
   you and your family to live in, compared with if you plan to rent the
   property as an investment.

   what the bank looks for when you apply for a loan

   Let's start with what banks look at when reviewing loan applications.

What do banks consider when reviewing loan applications?

   Lenders go through a range of checks before issuing a loan or credit
   product to encourage responsible borrowing and spending habits. These
   include checking:

   Credit history

   Lenders can find out about your credit history through credit reporting
   bodies - Equifax, Experian, and Illion.

   These organisations keep records of the loans you have applied for and
   how you've managed repayments. If you have made late repayments or
   defaulted on your credit reference checks in the past, this will likely
   be documented in your credit report.

   Your ability to maintain repayments

   IFRAME: [42]/blank.html

   Higher interest rates increase the repayments you need to make on a
   variable rate loan. You might have enough cash flow to meet loan
   repayments at current interest rates, but would that still be true if
   interest rates went up?

   Before a bank or lender issues a loan, they need to be confident that
   you can meet higher repayments if needed. This protects consumers from
   overextension and ensures their ongoing financial wellbeing.

   Security for the loan is adequate

   In general, the property you're buying with a mortgage is used to
   secure the loan - if you are unable to repay the debt, the lender can
   sell the property to recoup their money.

   But the lender might not accept the property as security if it's too
   small, or in a location or condition that could make it difficult to
   sell, for example.

   Some lenders may also accept a guarantee from a family member as
   security supported by property owned by the family member.

   This security can allow you to borrow a larger amount of money,
   however, the guarantors asset is also at risk and could then be used to
   repay the debt if ever you were to default and your own security
   property was not able to clear the debt in full.

How to give yourself the best chance of securing a loan

   Before you apply for a credit product, there are several steps you can
   take to help increase your chance of success.

   Be smart with savings and spending

   In the year or months before you apply for a loan, take stock of your
   savings and spending habits. How does your cash flow look? Lenders will
   need to check that you have the ability to manage a debt, even if you
   already have money for a deposit.

   Maintain a consistent income level

   This should be no problem if you receive regular income from an
   employer, however if you're casual or self-employed, you may need to
   provide extra proof that your income will be reliable enough to allow
   you to meet your repayments throughout the life of the loan.

   Keep your credit history clean

   Making loan and credit card payments on time can help you maintain a
   good credit history on credit reference checks. You can request a free
   copy of your credit report once every three months from Equifax,
   Experian or Illion to check your record.

How does capital gains tax work? When you have to pay and what the CGT rates
and allowances are for second homeowners, landlords and investors?

   Capital gains tax is levied on profits from assets ranging from shares
   to second homes, buy-to-let properties and personal possessions.

   It is traditionally applied at lower rates than income tax because the
   assets in question tend to be those on which people are taking a risk -
   whether an entrepreneurial one, or via investments held outside Isas
   and pensions.

   Employment income and savings interest are more guaranteed, and so
   taxed differently and more heavily.

   Your main home that you live in, known as your Principal Private
   Residence, is exempt from CGT. That, plus an annual tax-free allowance
   that until last April was £12,300, has meant CGT is typically levied on
   wealthier taxpayers.

   However, radical cuts to the CGT allowance by the Government make it
   inevitable that many more people will have to pay it in future.

HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP

     * [62]What you need to know each week: Listen to the This is Money
       podcast

Capital gains tax is levied on your profits

   Capital gains tax is paid on the profits when you sell an asset - what
   it sells for, less what you paid for it or it was worth when acquired.

   Depending on the asset there are reliefs available and each person has
   a capital gains tax allowance, which is currently £6,000, to offset
   against their gains.

Got a tax question?

   Heather Rogers, founder and owner of Aston Accountancy, is This is
   Money's tax columnist.

   She can answer your questions on any tax topic - tax codes, inheritance
   tax, income tax, capital gains tax, and much more.

   You can write to Heather at [63]taxquestions@thisismoney.co.uk.

   But the CGT tax-free allowance will be slashed again to £3,000 in April
   2024.

   'If an asset was transferred to you as a gift, then the value at
   transfer will be the valuation for acquisition,' says This is Money's
   tax expert Heather Rogers.

   'When the asset is left to you through a will, then the probate value
   will be the value you are deemed to have acquired it for.'

   Rogers adds: 'You can deduct costs of acquisition and disposal if
   relevant - the estate agent's and solicitor's fees on sale, for
   example. You can also deduct costs where you have spent money and have
   added value to the asset.'

   Regarding CGT rates, if you're a higher or additional rate taxpayer (40
   per cent or 45 per cent respectively) the CGT rate is 28 per cent on
   gains from residential property and 20 per cent on gains from other
   chargeable assets.

   For basic rate taxpayers (20 per cent), if your taxable gain plus your
   total taxable income fall within the basic income tax band of £12,571
   to £50,270, the CGT rate is 18 per cent on residential property and 10
   per cent on other gains.

   If the amount is higher, the CGT rate is 28 per cent on residential
   property and 20 per cent on other gains.

   The Government has [64]more information on CGT rates here.

   Rogers explains [65]how to carry forward capital losses to offset them
   against capital gains here.

   And she looks at which types of [71]personal possessions, referred to
   in this context as 'chattels', are liable for CGT and which are exempt
   here.

What do buy-to-let landlords need to know about CGT?

   When you come to sell your buy-to-let property, there will be capital
   gains tax to pay on any profit.

   It applies to any property which is not your main home - your Principal
   Private Residence - including private second homes as well.

   CGT is levied at the rates explained above, but as gains are added to
   income to deliver a total amount this means that in practice most
   landlords making decent profits should pay the 28 per cent rate.

   There are two reliefs you can get on your CGT bill, but they are both
   less generous than they once were.

   First, there is a capital gains tax regime specifically for
   'accidental' landlords, who once lived in a property before going on to
   let it out.

   If a landlord rents out a property that was once their main home,
   capital gains tax only applies on the amount the home went up in value
   while they weren't living there.

   Landlords can also add an extra nine months onto the amount of time
   they lived at the property - this is known as the 'final period
   exemption'.

   As an example of how this works,  a landlord who has owned their
   property for 10 years and lived in it for two would be taxed on seven
   years and three months of capital gains – the 10 years, minus the two
   years residency plus the reduced nine months' relief.

Ten tips for buy-to-let landlords

    Read This is Money's [72]guide to the essentials of property
   investment here.

   Another key [73]CGT allowance to be aware of is 'lettings relief'.

   When a landlord sells their former home after renting it out, up to
   £40,000 of their gain can be exempted from capital gains tax - but this
   now applies only if they lived in the property with their tenants.

   Meanwhile, you can reduce your CGT bill by deducting some of the
   expenses associated with buying and managing a property.

   You may also be able to offset losses on other property against your
   capital gains tax bill.

Did Fake Donors Give the Mayor Real Money? The F.B.I. Wants to Know.

   A search at the home of Mayor Eric Adams’s fund-raising chief sought
   information about a so-called straw donor scheme.

   By [17]Emma G. Fitzsimmons and [18]Michael Rothfeld
   Nov. 4, 2023

   It is a type of scheme that took down New York’s lieutenant governor
   last year, and sank the 2013 mayoral campaign of a top Democratic
   contender: the use of so-called straw donors to funnel illegal
   contributions to candidates from secret sources.

   Now, for the second time, the campaign of Mayor Eric Adams is being
   scrutinized for the same thing.

   On Thursday, the F.B.I. searched the home of Brianna Suggs, Mr. Adams’s
   chief fund-raiser, [19]as part of an investigation into whether his
   campaign had received illegal foreign campaign contributions from the
   Turkish government and Turkish nationals, disguised as coming from U.S.
   donors who had not actually given their own money, according to a
   search warrant.

   And in July, six men were indicted in Manhattan in connection with a
   similar scheme, accused of funneling thousands to Mr. Adams’s campaign.
   Two brothers have [20]pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor conspiracy charge
   in the case, and the news outlet The City and other organizations have
   [21]found additional inconsistencies in donations to the mayor’s
   campaign.

   Neither Mr. Adams nor Ms. Suggs has been accused of wrongdoing, and Mr.
   Adams has denied any knowledge of illegal contributions. But both
   investigations appear to be focused on whether donors who were eager to
   get Mr. Adams’s attention sought to mask large donations by funneling
   them through straw donors — and on who might have coordinated that
   effort.

Abstract

   This paper develops a model where money is demanded in excess of
   spending needs. As a result, money coexists with large availabilities
   of credit and the model explains the levels of monetary aggregates held
   in modern economies via the endogenous creation of inside money. At the
   heart of the model, there is a search friction in the goods market,
   which generates spare production and spending capacity. As a
   consequence, there is an endogenous productivity wedge, due to spare
   production capacity, and an endogenous money velocity, due to spare
   spending capacity.

   “The use of esteemed articles as a store or medium for conveying value
   may in some cases precede their employment as currency […] Such a
   generally esteemed substance as gold seems to have served, firstly, for
   ornamental purposes; secondly, as stored wealth; thirdly, as a medium
   of exchange.” Jevons ([34]1875)

   An unresolved question in monetary theory is why money coexists with
   the amount of credit and financial sophistication observed in modern
   societies. This is a problem because, in monetary theories where a role
   of money is not assumed ad hoc, credit crowds money out rather quickly.
   However, advancements in information technology are such that a range
   of financial arrangements that require information and commitment, such
   as credit and insurance products, are now increasingly available. While
   notable contributions demonstrated that it is possible to explain some
   coexistence, monetary equilibrium remains fragile to credit: Gu,
   Mattesini, and Wright ([35]2016) (GMW) find that the value of money and
   credit taken together cannot exceed that of transactions in a monetary
   equilibrium, so when there is enough credit to finance all equilibrium
   transactions, money has no value. This paper develops a model where
   credit can be larger than transactions and yet money has value. A
   second contribution is to show that the information and commitment
   frictions necessary to give money a role can be weak enough to allow
   for futures contracts through which it is possible to have equilibrium
   with full insurance.

   As a consequence of money coexisting with large availabilities of
   credit, the paper explains the apparently puzzling evidence that, as
   modern economies go increasingly cashless, more money is held by the
   private sector. To get a sense of the magnitudes, an aggregate measure
   of monetary holdings, such as M1, was 2.63 times larger than quarterly
   GDP during the COVID-19 pandemic; the number becomes 3.62 using either
   M2 or M3, and 4.19 using MZM. This is not just a recent phenomenon. For
   instance, M2 and M3 were larger than two times the quarterly GDP
   between 1960 and 1990. It seems that accounting for these quantities,
   which appear to be in large excess of transaction needs, should be a
   primary goal of monetary theory. But how to explain these figures?
   Credit is important here because it expands the monetary base into
   broader money supply. Therefore, broad money expands as credit becomes
   more available. However, the credit needed to match the aforementioned
   monetary aggregates is too large for monetary equilibrium in the
   existing microfounded models where money demand is not assumed ad hoc,
   but emerges endogenously as a consequence of deep frictions. This paper
   develops a model where agents demand liquidity in excess of their
   spending per capita. As a result, money is valued even when the money
   stock, or credit availabilities, are in excess of transactions per
   capita and it becomes possible to match the abovementioned
   monetary aggregates.

   The framework is a standard neoclassical model augmented with a credit
   limit and with a search friction in the goods market. As a result,
   spending opportunities are hard to find and it is optimal not to spend
   all available funds. Money demand emerges as a need to store these
   unspent funds: the difficulty to spend generates “left over money,” or
   money as a residual store of value to carry unspent wealth into the
   future. The paper shows that with this motive, money is demanded even
   when it is dominated as a transaction means.

   The model follows the new monetarist approach where, like here, there
   are information frictions that limit credit, and there is a search
   friction in the goods market. However, to accommodate the key mechanism
   that generates liquidity as a store of value, it proved convenient to
   develop a framework that departs from the standard new monetarist
   framework—Lagos and Wright ([36]2005) (LW)—and in a sense goes back to
   the seminal paper of Kiyotaki and Wright ([37]1989), where there is no
   centralized market. To understand, it is useful to start with LW. In
   that set-up, the search problem that spending opportunities are hard to
   find is resolved through an ex post Walrasian market where agents are
   free to adjust their composition of money and goods. As a result, money
   is demanded in the Walrasian market for its transaction value in the
   next period. This paper does not include a frictionless goods market.
   This absence generates an additional motive to hold money, thanks to
   which money is demanded even when it is dominated as a transaction
   means. To demonstrate this, I add a capital good that gives higher
   return than money and that can be turned into consumption at any time.
   With such a capital good, money would not be demanded in LW: an agent
   would leave the Walrasian market with capital and with no money because
   capital guarantees more consumption in the next period. However, the
   paper shows that without the Walrasian market, money is held not just
   for transaction purposes, but also as a consequence of the difficulty
   to turn liquid assets into goods: the lack of a centralized market
   makes capital hard to find. As a result, agents demand money to store
   value even if they prefer capital. So money is held not because it is
   easier to spend than capital (i.e., for transaction purposes), but
   because it is easier to acquire. Notice that this does not mean that
   money cannot then be used for transactions: if this was so, then money
   would not have value. But the transaction motive alone would not be
   sufficient to demand money because, as mentioned, agents prefer
   capital. To paraphrase, money is not demanded in order to make
   transactions easily, but rather because one does not make transactions
   easily.[38]1

   Relating money and assets, the mechanism offers a resolution to the
   esteemed rate of return dominance puzzle voiced by Hicks: why money and
   more remunerative assets coexist? Because money is easier to find (and
   not because it is easier to spend). As a result, the transaction motive
   can be minimal, and yet money demand is large and very robust to
   credit. In particular, the value of money and credit can be larger than
   income. This way it is possible to match the magnitudes of aggregate
   monetary holdings. A general equilibrium perspective helps understand
   why money demand is larger than income: aggregate income equals
   aggregate spending, but since unmatched agents are not spending their
   income, matched agents must spend more than their income. And because
   agents do not know whether they are going to be in a match, everyone
   wants access to spending power (money + credit) in excess of their
   income. As a result, even if individual credit is equal to income,
   money demand is still positive.[39]2

   This mechanism is also akin to the Baumol–Tobin (BT) model where an ad
   hoc cost generates a portfolio friction in reallocating wealth between
   a liquid asset and goods: recent examples include Alvarez and Lippi
   ([40]2009), Kaplan and Violante ([41]2014), and Ragot ([42]2014) who
   emphasize the role of money as a store asset in BT models. One can
   think of the search friction in this paper as a microfoundation of a
   resembling portfolio friction. From this perspective, a motivation for
   the microfoundation may be in order: while the BT framework proved
   useful for many applications, there the extent to which liquid assets
   play a role is a matter of degree arbitrarily set through a fixed cost.
   Instead here the portfolio problem is endogenous and related to the
   presence of information frictions and to the ability of the private
   sector to issue liabilities that play a role as a medium of exchange.
   As a result, the model speaks to the issue of coexistence of money and
   financial sophistication.[43]3

   To have credit, it is necessary to have some commitment. Like in Gu,
   Mattesini, and Wright ([44]2013) and GMW, it is shown how the level of
   commitment required can arise with participation constraints as in
   Kehoe and Levine ([45]1993) and Alvarez and Jermann ([46]2000), and
   imperfect monitoring. The information assumptions generate the
   incentives required to sustain some debt and preserve a role for money,
   see Kocherlakota ([47]1998) and Wallace ([48]2010). Furthermore, the
   paper shows that through the commitment generated, it is possible to
   have full insurance against the matching shocks and to sustain
   predetermined terms of trade (ToT). Being able to set the ToT in
   advance, it is possible to consider competitive search, which
   internalizes the search externality. This way, the model isolates the
   key spending problem of turning liquid into illiquid assets due to the
   search friction, but it is otherwise very close to a neoclassical
   setup. Insurance is introduced in this model via futures contracts.
   These contracts are welfare improving as they remove idiosyncratic risk
   without violating the borrowing limit.[49]4 That full insurance is
   implementable may seem surprising given that in Alvarez and Jermann
   ([50]2000) among others, not enough endogenous commitment is generated
   despite perfect monitoring. Indeed the derivation of the result is
   involved but the intuition is simple and boils down to a key
   assumption: agents caught reneging on their contracts pay their period
   obligations. In Alvarez and Jermann ([51]2000), agents can be punished
   by seizing all the assets that they may own, but the actual
   misappropriation cannot be garnished. As a result of the different
   assumption, in this paper, monitored default is always strictly worse
   than no default. Therefore, there is always a level of monitoring,
   which although imperfect, is high enough to ensure that to honor all
   obligations is incentive compatible.[52]5 While insurance markets and
   predetermined ToT are not key for the main results, they make the model
   analytically tractable while allowing for wealth effects and embedding
   this framework in an otherwise standard representative agent
   neoclassical model with capital, amenable to quantitative work.
   Insurance markets also highlight how monetary equilibrium does not
   hinge on their absence.

   Quantitatively, the extent to which the model generates large money
   demand and coexistence with credit depends on the severity of the
   search friction and in particular, on the probability of finding goods.
   For example, with a probability of 0.9, the monetary aggregate is 1.1
   times GDP; that number lies between M1 and M2 in prepandemic years.
   [53]6

   The paper also shows that when credit is not perfect, a monetary
   equilibrium is welfare improving relative to a nonmonetary equilibrium.
   This result is not uncommon in monetary models but the mechanism here
   is different: the possibility to store value in the liquid asset makes
   agents less preoccupied about not finding goods, thereby looking for
   better trading opportunities relative to the nonmonetary equilibrium
   where the liquid asset has no value.

   Technically, money leads to a lower market tightness (firms over
   buyers) where the probability of selling goods is higher for firms
   relative to the nonmonetary equilibrium. So money is desirable because
   it increases firms' ability to sell, that is, their measured
   productivity and overall transactions.[54]7 Similarly, inflation erodes
   the willingness of buyers to hold money; this increases the velocity of
   money and induces the buyers to choose a market tightness where it is
   easier for them to find goods, but harder for firms to sell. As a
   result, inflation leads to a decline in measured aggregate productivity
   (TFP).

   The link between endogenous TFP and velocity also has implications that
   relate to recent debates about a saving glut and secular stagnation. In
   particular, a quantitative paper that builds on this theory finds the
   suggested search mechanism to be a powerful source of recessions: as
   matching conditions deteriorate, buyers do not spend their money and
   firms do not sell their goods (surge in liquid savings, spare
   production capacity, and decline in productivity). This way the model
   not only generates a business cycle with an endogenous TFP wedge and
   the usual comovements in real variables, but it also accounts for the
   comovements of velocity and of capacity utilization with output, see
   Mennuni ([55]2021).[56]8

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section [57]1 sets up the model,
   Section [58]2 shows the results, Section [59]3 includes a simple
   application to match empirical monetary aggregates, and Section [60]4
   concludes. Appendix [61]A details the clearance of bonds,
   Appendix [62]B contains first-order conditions, Online Appendix [63]C
   details the off-equilibrium problems in case of default, and Online
   Appendix D contains the proofs.

1 THE MODEL

   Time is discrete. The economy is populated by a continuum of measure
   one of households that live forever. In each period, static firms
   produce goods for consumption and investment purposes with a
   neoclassical production function of labor and capital. Similarly to the
   standard neoclassical model, in each period firms sell goods to
   households while labor and capital inputs are supplied by households
   and demanded by firms. These two latter input markets are competitive.
   Instead, the market for goods is subject to a search friction.[64]9

   Besides consumption and capital, there is money: a costlessly storable,
   divisible and intrinsically useless object. Since this asset is
   homogeneous, it is not subject to the search friction. The money
   supply, denoted M, grows through lump-sum injections
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi mathvariant="normal">gt;Δ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\Delta
   m$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   made by a government to each household at the beginning of each period.

   Search is competitive as in Moen ([65]1997). In particular, the way
   households and firms meet and trade follows Menzio, Shi, and Sun
   ([66]2013) and is described next. There is a continuum of submarkets
   indexed by the ToT
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;

   <lt;mo>gt;×<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi mathvariant="double-struck">gt;R<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$(p,q) \in
   \mathbb {R}_+ \times \mathbb {R}_+$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , where p is the price per unit of good paid by the household (the
   buyer) and q the quantity sold by the firm (the seller). So
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is the payment of the buyer.[67]10 If a unit of production of size q is
   not matched with a household, it is destroyed. A firm chooses how many
   trading posts to create in each submarket (i.e., how many units of size
   q to put for sale in each submarket) and a household chooses which
   submarket to visit. It is convenient to use one of these submarkets as
   the numeraire. So p is the price of a good in a submarket relative to
   the price of the same good in the numeraire submarket.

   The buyer cannot visit multiple submarkets in the same period and can
   at most find one trading post. A household and a trading post meet in
   pairs; let the matching function μ be concave and homogeneous of degree
   1 in the number of trading posts f and households h, with continuous
   derivatives. In a submarket with tightness

   makes firms indifferent. Then, households' choices determine which
   submarket is going to be active over that menu.[70]12
   Similarly to the neoclassical model, the payment
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   need not take the form of money: firms also accept to deliver the good
   in exchange for private bonds. To clarify, it is useful to specify the
   following timing within the period.
     * (i) The input markets clear at the beginning but payment from firms
       to households is deferred to the end, after firms' revenues are
       realized.
     * (ii) After the input markets clear and before inputs are paid,
       households and firms meet in the frictional market. To pay,
       households can use money, bond holdings, or issue an intratemporal
       bond, a promise for later payment at the end of the period.
     * (iii) Firms use the proceedings (money or bonds) to remunerate the
       inputs.

   At maturity, bonds clear in money, or by clearance of net bond
   positions.[71]13 It is shown that, absent a credit limit on the ability
   to issue such bonds, money has no value. However, a key point of the
   paper is that the credit necessary for that case is very large. To
   clarify that the resilience of money to credit does not come from any
   other missing markets, I also consider an intertemporal bond to roll
   over any existing debt. This bond is perfectly liquid in the sense that
   firms are indifferent between it and money. However, it is shown that
   this bond is not traded in equilibrium.

   A further innovation is to introduce insurance against matching risk
   via futures contracts. This arrangement makes the model tractable and
   shows that the large demand for liquidity is not due to precautionary
   motives. Similarly to the big family assumption of Shi ([72]1997), the
   purpose is to redistribute goods between people that like the same
   variety. However, the arrangement does not assume a big family but is
   decentralized through the futures. This way, all agents are
   individually rational.

   The household has to honor the debt, the ToT agreed ex ante in the
   competitive search protocol, and the futures. In Section 2.4.1, I show
   that all these contracts are honored under the limited commitment that
   is enforceable with imperfect monitoring, which is required to make
   money essential as pointed out by Wallace ([73]2010). These frictions
   call for a limit on credit and an upper bound on the quantity q sold in
   a submarket. These two limits enable equilibrium with no endogenous
   default under the following assumption: to enter a submarket, one has
   to show proof of means, that is, one has to show enough money holdings
   and credit availability to afford the purchase in the submarket, should
   a match occur.[74]14 As in Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([75]2013), I
   model imperfect monitoring via a probability of being monitored.[76]15

   :MATH]
   and the probability of being caught does not increase if the agent
   defaults on the ToT and credit jointly. A justification for this
   restriction is that since households borrow from firms, default on the
   ToT and on the debt is a default on a firm. This restriction simplifies
   the exposition because, as a result, the firm never offers credit to
   someone that defaults on the ToT. This reduces the number of cases to
   consider but the results would hold more generally. Agents caught
   defaulting pay their period obligations and move to an unmonitored
   regime in which there are no consequences from defaulting. As a result,
   they lose access to credit as they would ex post default on it.
   However, it is shown that submarkets with low prices and a limited
   amount of insurance are incentive compatible even when there is no
   endogenous threat so they retain limited access to the futures market
   and to some submarkets.

   Finally, firms have incentives to default on the ToT and on the payment
   to the inputs. To avoid this, firms are monitored with some probability
   and in case of monitored default, all revenues are confiscated. The
   monitoring of the firm does not disclose the identity of the buyer. As
   I argue later, with enough firm monitoring, firms constraints are slack
   as they are looser than the ones of the household, and thus can be
   ignored. Since the emphasis in this paper is on the household, I assume
   that there is such a level of firms monitoring.

1.1 Planning Problem under Perfect Monitoring

   To understand how this model works, it is instructive to start with a
   planning problem with perfect monitoring. The main takeaway is that the
   efficient allocation is the one of the neoclassical model with no
   search frictions.

   Definition 1.Under perfect monitoring, an allocation is efficient if it
   solves the following:

   The planner chooses market tightness θ (or equivalently the number of
   trading posts f as households have measure 1 so
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$f=\theta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ).

   Constraint ([77]2) ensures that total production is not smaller than
   the quantity offered by each trading post (q) times the number of
   trading posts θ.[78]16 Resource constraint ([79]3) states that
   consumption and investment are smaller or equal to the amount of goods
   exchanged, which in turn is equal to the supply of the trading posts
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi (\theta )$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   .

   Notice that there are no incentive constraints because of perfect
   monitoring. Also, there is no household's heterogeneity resulting from
   the fact that some agents are matched and some are not because the
   preferences are such that it is efficient to redistribute all goods
   found equally across households. As a result, this planning problem
   assumes degenerate consumption and capital distributions without loss
   of generality.
   It should be fairly straightforward to see that it is optimal to have
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;munder>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta =\underline{\theta }$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . This is because Constraints ([80]2) and ([81]3) imply
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo linebreak="badbreak">gt;+<lt;/mo>gt;

   \end{equation}$$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   (4)
   From this last equation, it is evident that the lowest θ the better, as
   this way ϕ is as large as possible and most of the production is either
   consumed or invested. As
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta \rightarrow
   0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there is no “waste” because
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and the allocation coincides with the one of the neoclassical
   model.[82]17 To better understand why it is optimal to have θ as small
   as possible, it is useful to draw a comparison with labor search models
   such as Mortensen and Pissarides ([83]1994); there market tightness is
   given by the ratio between vacancies and unemployment. If vacancies
   were free to post, free entry would imply infinite vacancies. A
   previous version of the paper included effort costs associated to
   searching for q, which had the role played by vacancy posting costs in
   Mortensen and Pissarides ([84]1994), leading to an efficient market
   tightness bounded away from zero.

   The fact that this model, absent vacancy costs and information
   frictions, has the same allocation as the neoclassical model, will help
   isolate the effects of the information frictions in the decentralized
   economy, and the role of money.

   From ([85]4), it is also possible to appreciate how the matching
   probability ϕ is related to TFP: through the lens of a neoclassical
   model, a high
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi (\theta )$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   would be captured by a higher TFP parameter. So in this model, the
   Solow residual is endogenous. Intuitively, the higher ϕ, the less
   waste. Later, it is shown that also money holdings and velocity are
   related to the matching probabilities.

1.2 Households in the Decentralized Economy

   Households' liquid funds at the beginning of a period are

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m (m+\Delta m) +a$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , where m is money held from the previous period,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;annotation

   (6)
   The first constraint avoids a too strong hold-up problem that induces
   default on the ToT. The second constraint limits transactions to liquid
   wealth + credit:
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≥<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;

   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is the maximum the household can borrow from the firm by issuing the
   intratemporal bond. This form of borrowing must be cleared by the end
   of the period and may be thought of as credit card debt. This way to
   introduce credit resembles GMW. While others have introduced credit in
   different ways, drawing on several specific characteristics, which all
   have elements of truth (see Cavalcanti and Wallace [87]1999, Marimon,
   Nicolini, and Teles [88]2003, Berentsen, Camera, and Waller [89]2007,
   Telyukova and Wright [90]2008, Sanches and Williamson [91]2010, and
   Nosal and Rocheteau [92]2011, among others), this approach seems the
   most appropriate for this paper as, up to the borrowing limit, credit
   is perfectly substitutable to money, making the coexistence problem
   more transparent because money has no transaction advantage. Absent
   credit (
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a=B=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ), equation ([93]6) would be a familiar transaction constraint where
   goods can only be paid with money. However, the paper shows that credit
   can be larger than transactions per capita and yet money has value.

Insurance

   That some agents trade and others do not gives scope for insurance.
   However, insurance is problematic in monetary models. This is either
   because monetary equilibria are not robust to the presence of insurance
   against idiosyncratic shocks—such as in Bewley economies—or because
   insurance needs monitoring and commitment, which are ruled out to avoid
   credit. This section describes the insurance decentralization assuming
   no default in equilibrium. Then, Section 2.4.1 shows that the
   decentralization is incentive compatible under the informational
   frictions that give money a role.

   Households that like the same variety can insure among themselves using
   futures. The futures contract is an agreement between two households
   where one party commits to transfer a given amount of goods should she
   succeed to match with a firm and should the other household be
   unmatched. In turn, the unmatched household commits to pay a given
   price. These futures insure against matching risk but must not violate
   the borrowing limit.[97]21

   Before studying insurance, it is worth discussing the meaning of goods
   redistribution with search frictions given that inherent in the said
   friction, there is the idea that agents have heterogenous tastes and
   may not like any goods redistributed to them. A possible taste and
   information structure that makes goods redistribution desirable is that
   goods come in different varieties and each household can only store a
   subset of varieties but the variety offered at each trading post is not
   known before visiting the trading post. After purchases are made, there
   can be redistribution between households that like the same variety.
   This requires that buyers know other buyers that have similar tastes.
   However, they cannot tell the variety offered by each trading post
   before visiting it.[98]22 It should be noticed that this theory of
   money does not hinge on this insurance assumption: it would be possible
   to write the model without the insurance market and allow for
   heterogeneity to spread.

   Since the futures are in zero net supply (each agent has long and short
   positions that cancel out), there is an equivalent and simpler
   representative agent problem shown in Section 2.2.3 where these futures
   are not explicitly included but they are present in the background so
   that all idiosyncratic risk washes out. For the reader that is not
   interested in the details on the futures, it is enough to understand
   that the futures do what is explained next, and then jump to
   Section 2.2.3. Further details of the decentralization with the futures
   explicitly modeled is included in Section 2.2.2.

   The outcome is as follows. Assuming the law of large numbers so that ψ
   is the exact share of the population that successfully made a
   transaction, all households that participated in the same submarket by
   being ready to pay
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;x<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . In turn, those that receive the goods transfer make a payment of

   in liquid assets. It is easy to check that this way each agent in the

   so that the end-of-period liquid balance is
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mrow>gt;

   for all.

   It is worth relating this insurance mechanism to the alternatives
   provided by the monetary literature. The key tension is to achieve the
   tractability of a representative agent environment while maintaining
   the assumption of anonymity and lack of commitment needed to rule out
   credit. The solutions are either to adopt the timing and preference
   structure developed in LW, or to assume big families as in Shi
   ([99]1997). As discussed further in Section 2.2.3, the LW approach
   would remove the spending problem that is key in generating monetary
   equilibrium with credit limits larger than transactions. The futures'
   scheme achieves an outcome similar to the seminal paper of Shi
   ([100]1997), but it resolves some incentives issues present in that
   approach: in Shi ([101]1997), although agents are not monitored so that
   trades are quid pro quo, individual incentive conditions are not taken
   into account as agents act not in their own self interest, but by the
   rules prescribed by the head of the household.

Insurance through futures contracts

   Each household can issue futures with which she commits to transfer
   goods at the given price to another household should she succeed to
   match with a firm and should the other agent be unmatched. The
   transaction constraint ([102]6) becomes

   , the constraints ([104]8) and ([105]9) coincide and boil down to the
   ones of Section 2.2.3 with perfect insurance. Clearly, if this outcome
   does not violate any constraint, it must hold in a solution to the
   household's problem given the concave preferences and that the budget
   set is convex (as shown in Section [106]2.1). So, it needs to be shown
   that full insurance is implementable.

   m, and bonds a. For recursive equilibria, the aggregate state Ω is
   composed of the aggregate capital stock K and money M, and possibly of
   a vector of shocks with a known Markov process.

   , where ∃ stands for equilibrium meaning that the borrowing constraint
   may be equilibrium specific (e.g., whether the equilibrium is monetary
   or not). This formulation comes from the incentive restrictions as
   shown in Section 2.4.1.[113]24

   Equation ([114]15) shows that only a fraction ψ of demand q is matched

   <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$(1-\psi )q$<lt;/annotation>gt;

   to the unmatched agents in her insurance scheme, or she was unmatched

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . What is left of her liquid funds is invested in liquid assets as
   shown in ([115]16): the right-hand side shows the end of period balance
   after insurance, as elaborated earlier. From this latter equation, it
   is intuitive why money may have value in this economy:
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;

   implies that not all available funds

   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m +a+B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   can be spent in goods. As formalized later, if B is not too large, the
   right-hand side of ([116]16) is positive, that is, there is left over
   wealth, which gives rise to money or bond demand. Since bonds are in
   zero net supply, in equilibrium
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a^{\prime }=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   and there is positive money demand.[117]25

   So, the harder it is to find goods (i.e., the smaller ψ), the larger
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;msup>gt;

Store of value versus transaction motive, a comparison to Lagos–Wright

   Notice that the latter is a different explanation than the transaction
   one according to which money is acquired today in order to be able to
   purchase goods tomorrow. Rather, money is demanded because one was not
   able to make purchases today (store of value motive). This is an
   important distinction because, as argued next, in this model money is
   demanded even though it is dominated as a way to acquire goods (i.e.,
   as a transaction means) and so it would not be demanded if it was not
   for the other role, as an easy to find store of value.

   To appreciate further the sense in which the transaction motive is
   muted and instead highlight the role of the spending problem, notice
   that here, if the spending problem was addressed by giving an agent the
   chance to rebalance her money-goods holdings (similar to an
   end-of-period centralized market as in LW), she would spend everything
   to buy goods and leave with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$m^{\prime }=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   . This is because capital goods pay higher dividends than money and,
   crucially, they can be consumed at any time.[119]27 This does not mean
   that money does not have a transaction role: indeed money relaxes the
   transaction constraint ([120]14) and if it was not so, then money would
   not have value. But this motive alone would not be sufficient to demand
   money if an agent had a way to circumvent the spending problem because,
   as mentioned, agents prefer capital. Instead, in models that have a
   more prominent transaction role, agents do not turn all money into
   goods even without the spending problem as is the case in the
   centralized market in LW.

   This discussion highlights the importance of the spending friction to
   induce money demand. However, it should be noticed that households
   effectively choose the probability of finding goods ψ (and thereby
   end-of period money holdings) by choosing p and q, which determines
   market tightness given the equilibrium function
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta (p,q)$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . They can also choose
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi \rightarrow
   1$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , so that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;msup>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m^{\prime } \rightarrow
   0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and they are left with goods only. If households prefer goods to money,
   why would they willingly choose a low ψ and therefore to hold money?
   Intuitively, to overcome the friction and have
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is too expensive, so agents choose to leave funds unspent and store
   them in money. This portfolio choice is explained in detail next.

The portfolio choice of turning liquid assets into goods

   The first-order condition for p illustrates the key trade-off in the
   decision of buying goods versus holding money. Focusing on an interior
   solution and assuming B independent of p for simplicity, the
   equation is

   increases (it is shown later that θ is increasing in p so that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt;
   <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\frac{\partial \theta
   }{\partial p}>gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ), this increases ψ so that agents end up with more goods, thereby
   relaxing ([123]15) as captured by
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;λ<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mn>gt;3<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\frac{\partial \psi }{\partial \theta }
   \lambda _3$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . However, with the increase in ψ, agents are left with less liquid
   funds, this tightens ([124]16) as captured in the first term in the
   right-hand side where λ[4] is the multiplier on ([125]16). Finally,
   there is a last term in brackets, which is positive. It follows that
   the net of the first two effects is positive and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;λ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mn>gt;3<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;λ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mn>gt;4<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\lambda _3>gt; \lambda _4
   p$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   : put differently, the goods constraint ([126]15) with multiplier λ[3]
   bites more than the financial constraint ([127]16) with multiplier λ[4]
   so that agents prefer goods to money. If it was for these two effects
   only, they would put
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   so that all funds are turned into goods.[128]28 However, there is the
   last term in brackets, which captures the fact that to find more goods
   is hard: one has to increase θ, which in turn increases the cost per
   unit of good (higher p): this tightens constraints ([129]14) and
   ([130]16). Because of this last term, it can be optimal not to turn all
   liquid assets into goods.

1.3 Firms

   Firms can choose to open trading posts in any market identified by
   price and quantity. A trading post in market
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$(p,q)$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   has a match with probability
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi (\theta
   (p,q))$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , in which case, it sells q. To open a trading post, a firm needs
   production capacity
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;A<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;msubsup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;d<lt;/mi>gt;

   <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;α<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/msubsup>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≥<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$A k_d^\alpha n_d^{1-\alpha

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$k_d$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;n<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;d<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$n_d$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   are the capital and labor inputs. So a firm pays labor and capital
   costs whether or not a match is found.[131]29 Notice that since to open
   a trading post carries input costs, there is no need to assume
   exogenous vacancy posting costs.

   The assumption of Cobb–Douglas production function is not key. Any
   function with the neoclassical properties would work.

       q}=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       .

   The proof in the Online Appendix follows from Equation ([133]24) and
   the properties of the function ϕ. Since the function θ does not depend
   on q, from now on, it will be denoted
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta (p)$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   . The intuition why θ does not depend on q is that, since the
   production function has constant returns to scale and input prices are
   taken as given, production increases proportionally with costs. Then,
   for profits to be equal to 0 (and hence independent of q), ϕ and
   thereby θ have to also be independent of q.

   Finally, it is worth discussing the issue that trading posts pay the
   input markets irrespective of whether they are in a match and make
   revenues. For this, it is necessary to assume that the law of large
   numbers holds within each submarket so that there is perfect ex post
   redistribution of revenues between trading posts in the same submarket.
   It should be noticed that this ex post redistribution does not require
   firms to commit to an explicit insurance scheme between them because a
   single firm can open a large number of trading posts. See Menzio, Shi,
   and Sun ([134]2013) for a similar discussion.

1.4 Equilibrium

   It is convenient to first define equilibrium assuming that agents honor
   all obligations given the limits B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , and then find the information and enforcement frictions that make
   this behavior optimal.

   Before defining an equilibrium, it is useful to pick a numeraire.
   Equation ([135]24) pins down a relationship between θ and p up to a
   value for revenues per unit of production ξ. ξ is free and can be
   normalized.[136]30 As a normalization, ξ is equal to the equilibrium
   value of ϕ. This implies
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p=1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   in the equilibrium submarket as is immediate from equation
   ([137]24).[138]31

   Below there are formal definitions of a recursive monetary and a
   nonmonetary equilibrium given a debt limit function. In a monetary
   equilibrium, it is also necessary to pin down the money growth rate, or
   equivalently the return on bonds v as an exogenous policy instrument.
   The definition below uses the latter as the policy instrument.[139]32

   Definition 3.Nonmonetary equilibrium assuming no default

   A nonmonetary equilibrium is the same but with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and with v endogenous.

   Besides the fact that market clearing occurs with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m>gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   in a monetary equilibrium and with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   in a nonmonetary one, the other difference is that a monetary
   equilibrium depends on a policy for the price of bonds v. Instead, in a
   nonmonetary equilibrium, v is pinned down. Intuitively, v is not
   endogenously determined in a monetary equilibrium because the supply of
   money is exogenous. In a nonmonetary equilibrium, the value of the
   supply of money is zero so v must adjust endogenously to ensure that
   agents do not demand excess liquidity.

   As it is well known, monetary economies also have nonrecursive monetary
   equilibria but this paper focuses on recursive ones.

Imperfect monitoring and limited commitment

   The household has to honor the debt, the ToT agreed ex ante in the
   competitive search protocol, and the insurance mechanism. Here, I show
   that all these contracts are honored under the limited commitment that
   is enforceable with imperfect monitoring, which is required to make
   money essential as pointed out by Kocherlakota ([146]1998) and Wallace
   ([147]2010). Agents can renege on any of the contracts mentioned above
   but the commitment is endogenized introducing participation constraints
   following Thomas and Worrall ([148]1988), Kehoe and Levine ([149]1993),
   and Alvarez and Jermann ([150]2000) among others.
   There are two assumptions, which, although stated in the initial
   description of the set-up, it is worth repeating as they are key here.
     * (a) Agents caught red handed reneging one of their contracts pay
       their period obligations and lose access to any form of endogenous
       commitment. That agents pay their obligations if caught makes the
       value of default and being caught always lower than the value of
       honoring all obligations. This is a key assumption to sustain full
       insurance with imperfect monitoring.
     * (b) Agents must provide proof of means before entering a submarket.
       Without proof of means, one could pretend to be cash rich and go
       for a submarket with q very large, and then default at the moment
       of paying.

   With the two assumptions, the constructed strategies with full
   insurance, predetermined ToT, and credit with spending limits B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   as in Definitions [151]1 and 2 are incentive compatible, and, thus, are
   part of an equilibrium microfounded by imperfect monitoring and limited
   commitment.[152]34 A detailed description of the off-equilibrium
   problems in case of default is included in Online Appendix C. However,
   the key intuition for the proposition below is simple and does not
   require reading the appendix: because of assumption (a), monitored
   default is always strictly worse than no default. As a result, it is
   always possible to find monitoring probabilities high enough, but
   smaller than one, such that it is incentive compatible to honor all
   obligations. The result is formalized in Proposition [153]1.

   Proposition 1.Equilibrium with endogenous obligations

   Take a solution that satisfies Equilibrium Definition [154]2 or [155]3
   given bounded B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there are probabilities
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;T<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;o<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;T<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;b<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_{ToT}, p_b, p_f<lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   such that there are no incentives to default. The probabilities tend to
   1 as B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   tend to ∞.

   Proposition [156]1 states that the decentralization with bounded limits
   B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   satisfies the incentive constraints with imperfect monitoring. So there
   are no incentives to default under these limits. Notice that this
   approach does not restrict attention exclusively to the “not too tight”
   limits of Alvarez and Jermann ([157]2000), that is, those where the
   participation constraints hold with equality. As in Bethune, Hu, and
   Rocheteau ([158]2018), this approach also allows for lower limits where
   some or all the conditions hold with strict inequality. Why would the
   market restrict credit below the highest possible one? Bethune, Hu, and
   Rocheteau ([159]2018) show that tighter limits than the “not too tight”
   ones are consistent with perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In particular,
   Bethune, Hu, and Rocheteau ([160]2018) show that if firms follow a
   strategy that punishes default up to some limit, there are no
   incentives to deviate and offer higher
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   or B: any larger debt would be defaulted on because, under the
   equilibrium strategy, there would be no punishment from the
   other firms.

   Besides the fact that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B must be below the “not too tight” ones, a limitation to their
   shape comes from the fact that the buyer is anonymous, so
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B should be functions of variables that are easily observable to
   the seller: hence in this paper, I rule out limits that are functions
   of the individual state variables. In Section 2.2.3, they are functions
   of the aggregate state variables and of p, which is known by the seller
   and does not preclude the anonymity of the buyer.

   That
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B are flexible within the upper bound is convenient and later some
   examples are considered. Yet, the microfoundation is not
   inconsequential. For instance, it matters for monetary policy: moving
   the interest rate
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$1/v-1$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the value functions change and, holding the probabilities constant,
   it may be necessary to change B and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   in order not to violate the incentive constraints. This has
   implications for optimal policy, see Berentsen, Camera, and Waller
   ([161]2007), Araujo and Hu ([162]2018), Gomis-Porqueras and Sanches
   ([163]2013), and Lotz and Zhang ([164]2016).

   As mentioned, firms have incentives to default too but the resulting
   constraints can be ignored by assuming enough, albeit imperfect firm
   monitoring. This is explained next. Firms have incentives to default on
   the ToT (if p is too low and q too high) and on the payment to the
   inputs
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;n<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$wn+rk$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . It follows that given the monitoring probability, all is needed to
   avoid firms default is a lower bound on market tightness θ. This is
   because p is decreasing in θ while q and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;n<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$wn+rk$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   are increasing in θ. So a low θ brings all the aforementioned
   incentives to default. However, submarkets with low market tightness
   are also ruled out by households' default incentives.[165]35 It follows
   that if there is enough firm monitoring so that the constraint on θ
   that comes from the incentives of the firms is looser than the one that
   comes from the incentives of the hosueholds, one can solve the model
   ignoring the constraint of the firm. Since the emphasis in this paper
   is on the household, I make this assumption and only focus on the
   incentive constraints of the household. However, it is worth noting
   that one cannot simply assume perfect firm monitoring. In that case,
   there would be scope for a firm to become a market maker that collects
   all the money from the buyers before the matching process, and then use
   the proceedings to pay the trading posts that are successful. If that
   was possible, then the market maker could exploit the law of large
   numbers and ask just enough money to finance the determinisitic number
   of matches, see Faig and Huangfu ([166]2007). Instead, without the
   market maker, there is more money demand because buyers can only use
   their own liquidity in a match and so each buyer needs more money or
   credit than with the market maker. One final worry is that when the
   monitoring probability of the households tends to 1, for the incentive
   constraints of the firm to be looser than the one of the household, the
   monitoring probability of the firm must go to 1 as well. In such cases,
   the market planner becomes incentive feasible. However, its presence
   becomes irrelevant because as per Proposition [167]1, with perfect
   monitoring, any level of obligation is enforceable. And it is shown
   later that in such a case, money is not essential.

2 CHARACTERIZATION

   Since this is a new framework, I start with finding conditions under
   which the constraint set faced by the household is convex to ensure a
   well-behaved household problem.

2.1 Concavity of the Household Problem

   That the constraint set is convex is not obvious because of the
   nonlinear terms
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi p q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , and the functions
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;/mover>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo>gt;·<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}(\cdot )$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;·<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B(\cdot )$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   in the constraints ([168]13)–([169]17). As shown in Section 2.4.1, the
   functions
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B consistent with incentives to repay can take many shapes below an
   upper bound. As a result, it is not difficult to pick functions that do
   not pose a problem for the convexity of the constraint set. So, for
   simplicity, here I focus on
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B constant.

   To ensure that the constraint set faced by the households is convex, it
   is also necessary to restrict the matching function such that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$1/(\phi \psi )$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   is convex in θ. Since ψ and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;∈<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;[<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;]<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi \in [0,1]$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   are monotone, one with positive and one with negative slope, this
   property is fairly natural: as θ approaches either zero or infinity,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi \psi$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   tends to zero, so its inverse goes to infinity. In between
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi \psi$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   is larger, so its inverse is smaller. As a result,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation

   \psi \le 1$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . While microfounded matching functions satisfy these inequalities
   (such as the urn ball one, which indeed exhibits a convex

   ), such inequalities do not hold for some of the matching functions
   used in practice, such as the Cobb–Douglas. Indeed, a Cobb–Douglas

   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma \ge 0.5$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   goes as follows. In choosing the submarket, buyers face the following
   trade-off: a low p implies a low θ and thus a low ψ. If the price is
   too elastic to θ, a reduction in θ reduces the price so much that
   buyers are likely to choose the submarket with minimum price, that is,
   a corner solution. Using equation ([170]24), it is easy to show that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$1-\gamma$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is the elasticity of p to θ. So a high γ ensures a sufficiently low
   elasticity, which in turn ensures convexity of the budget constraint
   and thus an interior solution.

   is a convex function, then the constraint set ([171]13)–([172]17)
   is convex.

   Given the strictly concave preferences, the convexity of the constraint
   set ensures a unique and interior solution to the household's problem
   and it is safe to use first-order conditions, shown in Appendix [173]B,
   to characterize optimal choices.

2.2 Coexistence

   I will now show existence and uniqueness of monetary/nonmonetary
   equilibrium in steady state and for constants
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and B (and for underlying monitoring probabilities that make commitment
   under those constraints incentive compatible as in Proposition [174]1).
   The results, stated in Lemma [175]2 and Proposition [176]3, are
   explained below and illustrated in Figure [177]1. Readers that are not
   so interested in the technical details can jump to the text after
   Proposition [178]3 where Figure [179]1 is explained.
   [180]Details are in the caption following the image
   Fig 1

   Equilibria Given B.

   From equation ([183]14) it is clear that, since
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a=0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , an equilibrium is monetary (
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m>gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ) iff
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq>gt; B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . And since p is normalized to 1, one has to check that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q>gt;B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . Since
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≤<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q\le \bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   , it follows that monetary equilibrium requires
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;/mover>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≥<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}\ge B$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   .

   The strategy is this: given a price of bonds
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v>gt;\beta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , look for a candidate solution that satisfies all equilibrium
   conditions other than ([184]14). If the equilibrium candidate has
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≥<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q\ge B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , then that is indeed a monetary equilibrium. It is a monetary
   equilibrium because
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m>gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   to satisfy ([185]14), and (as shown in the proof of Proposition [186]3)
   all other equilibrium conditions are unaffected by
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m>gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . If
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q=B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , then that is a nonmonetary equilibrium because
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   satisfies ([187]14) and in the proof of Lemma [188]2, it is shown that
   with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v>gt;\beta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , ([189]14) cannot be slack. If
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q<lt;B$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , then the candidate solution is not an equilibrium because the value
   of money would have to be negative.

   The strategy above works to the extent that given v, there is a unique
   candidate monetary equilibrium q, and this is shown in the following
   lemma. The proof is quite tedious but conceptually it is done in a
   similar fashion as in Brock and Mirman ([190]1972) by showing the
   existence of a unique solution to some key equilibrium conditions. In
   particular, the main difficulty is to show existence of a solution for
   θ. To this aim, Lemma [191]2 requires a technical assumption on the
   matching function: the elasticity
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$- \frac{\phi }{\theta } \frac{\partial
   \theta }{\partial \phi }$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   must be decreasing and larger than zero at
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta =0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and below a certain bound for large θ. Intuitively, the restriction
   ensures that ϕ does not go to 0 or to 1 too fast. To see this, notice
   that holding constant
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mrow>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\frac{\partial \theta }{\partial \phi
   }$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   the two limits are satisfied because
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi (\theta )$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   is decreasing and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi (0)=1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . Then, to satisfy the limits, it is required that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∂<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mrow>gt;

   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\frac{\partial \theta }{\partial \phi
   }$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   does not go to 0 or to minus infinity too fast and in the opposite way
   than
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$- \frac{\phi
   }{\theta }$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . It is worth stressing that the restriction on these elasticities is a
   sufficient condition, not necessary for the existence of an
   equilibrium.[192]36

   The lemma also reports what happens as
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v \rightarrow
   \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   when constraint ([194]13) on q is nonbinding.[195]37 In this case,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∞<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q\rightarrow
   \infty$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . Intuitively, the cost of choosing a market with low price and high q
   is low market tightness θ, low matching probability ψ, and large liquid
   assets. But ending up with liquid assets is not a cost when their
   return approaches that of capital, that is, when
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;↘<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v\searrow \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . So, in this case, agents choose a market with price tending to zero
   and q tending to infinity.[196]38 That q tends to infinity as
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v \rightarrow

   implies that there is monetary equilibrium for any bounded B. However,
   with monitoring probabilities that tend to 1, the highest possible
   (“not too tight”) B tends to ∞. So, while monetary equilibrium can be
   constructed (because the debt limit need not be the “not too tight”
   one), there is a nonmonetary equilibrium with the same allocation. In
   this sense, money is not essential with perfect monitoring, confirming
   Wallace ([197]2010). Yet, from an empirical perspective, it is
   interesting that monetary equilibrium can be constructed even with
   arbitrarily large credit.

   candidate equilibrium is a monetary equilibrium, a nonmonetary one, or
   not an equilibrium, depending on ([198]14). This is formalized in the

   and the value of money would have to be negative. Intuitively, money is
   not demanded if its return is too low, or equivalently, if inflation is
   too high. So there is an upper limit on inflation, which is tighter the
   larger is the debt limit B.

   The figure is shown for the case in which

   , it follows from the proposition that there is no
   monetary equilibrium.

Endogenous productivity, inflation, and velocity

   In Figure [201]1, q is decreasing in v and as
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v\rightarrow
   \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∞<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q\rightarrow
   \infty$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   (provided that monitoring probabilities tend to 1 so that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;¯<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mover>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\bar{q}$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   can go to infinity). Intuitively,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v\rightarrow
   \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is the Friedman Rule, in which case, inflation is negative and money
   gives the same return as capital. As a result there is no private cost
   of not finding goods and holding high liquidity so agents choose a
   market with low θ and low ψ. Instead, inflation prevents θ from going
   to its efficient lower bound because it makes it privately costly to
   hold money. This leads agents to choose markets with higher θ so that
   there is a higher probability of finding a match and spend the money.
   However, the higher the matching probability for a buyer, the lower it
   is for a seller. As shown studying the planning problem, low θ is
   efficient because it implies high ϕ, which can be interpreted as firms
   productivity: through the lens of a neoclassical model, a high ϕ would
   be captured by a higher TFP parameter. So in this model, the Solow
   residual is endogenous and higher, the lower the inflation rate or
   v.[202]39

   The relationship between market tightness θ and endogenous productivity
   highlights the role of demand in this model: there is a social benefit
   if households search in crowded markets (where the ratio of households
   per trading posts is high), because the higher the demand for each
   trading post, the less production is unutilized.

   In this model also, velocity is an endogenous function of θ. Indeed the
   velocity of broad money (i.e., money plus credit such as M1, M2, MZM)
   in this model is ψ. This is because velocity is defined as output over
   broad money, which in this model is equal to q. Since production is
   equal to
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;δ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$c+k^{\prime }-k(1-\delta )$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , it follows from ([203]15) that velocity is ψ. Intuitively, a change
   in velocity is equivalent to a change in spare spending capacity (i.e.,
   a change in ψ). That velocity is endogenous is interesting because it
   is hard to get velocity to move at all in monetary models. Furthermore,
   Mennuni ([204]2021) builds on this theory and finds it to be promising
   to explain how velocity moves over the business cycle.

2.3 Monetary Equilibrium with Credit Above Income

   It is now possible to appreciate better a key point of the paper, that
   is, the extent to which money is robust to credit. To this aim, it is
   useful to relate q to income. From equation ([205]16), and using the
   fact that in equilibrium
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p=1$<lt;/annotation>gt;

   ,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a=a^{\prime }=0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , and
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi mathvariant="normal">gt;Δ<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$m^{\prime
   }=m+\Delta m$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , one gets
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo linebreak="badbreak">gt;=<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo linebreak="goodbreak">gt;+<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;.<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$$\begin{equation} q=(w+rk)/\psi .
   \end{equation}$$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   (26)
   Since
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the equation above shows that q is larger than income
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$w+rk$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , which in turn is equal to aggregate transactions. And since monetary
   equilibrium exists if
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there are levels of B larger than income or transactions for which
   there is monetary equilibrium.

   In more intuitive terms, in equilibrium aggregate spending must equal
   aggregate income. As a result, if buyers matching probability ψ is
   smaller than 1 so that not all agents get to spend, then those in a
   match must spend more than their income. It follows that, for an
   equilibrium to exist, agents need spending capacity (money + credit) in
   excess of their individual income. As a result, money demand is
   positive even when credit is larger than individual income, but smaller
   than spending. Notice that this result comes from the general
   equilibrium requirement that spending is equal to income in the
   aggregate, which is true with or without insurance. Furthermore, this
   result is true also outside steady state and for any function B that
   has equilibrium: whenever
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   money has value from ([206]14). This result is important because with B
   larger than income, it is possible to have outside + inside money
   larger than GDP, as in the data.

   Moreover, since as shown in Lemma [207]2,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;lim<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt;

   <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\lim _{v\searrow
   \beta } q=\infty$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there can be monetary equilibrium for any bounded constant B
   (provided that there is enough monitoring to satisfy incentives not to
   default). So there can be monetary equilibrium as long as credit is not
   infinite. As mentioned, this latter result requires deflation and would
   not hold if agents had to pay vacancy costs proportional to q. In that
   case, q would be finite for any v. Vacancy costs would not change the
   result that there is monetary equilibrium with credit larger than
   income as from ([208]26), since
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≤<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;

   .

   Since the result is a key point of the paper, it is summarized in the
   following corollary.

   Corollary 1.For each
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v>gt; \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the maximum credit limit consistent with monetary equilibrium is
   larger than transactions and equal to
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q(v)$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , which is decreasing in v and tends to infinity as
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v\rightarrow
   \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   .

   An intuition for why money is robust to credit larger than income goes
   as follows. Because of the search friction, some agents do not buy
   goods, yet they make income and want a store of value so that they can
   spend it in the future. There are two options: either to lend to other
   buyers, or to buy the fiat asset. If the borrowing limit is large
   enough so that the buyers in a match can borrow not just their own
   income, but also that of the agents that did not make a match, then
   there is no need for a fiat asset. This requires the buyers in a match
   to borrow q. If
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , then not all the income of the unmatched agents can be lent so there
   must be another asset in positive net supply, which on the one hand
   stores the savings of the unmatched and on the other gives to the
   agents in a match the purchasing power to spend for the income of the
   agents not in a match.[209]40

   To summarize, in equilibrium aggregate income equals aggregate
   spending. But since some agents do not get to spend their income, those
   in a match need means to spend more than their income. So the key is
   that agents make income but may not find spending opportunities,
   thereby ending up with “unwanted” liquid savings. This is not the case
   in LW: the CM makes it such that there are no “unwanted” liquid income
   savings and, through a period (DM+CM), each agent spends exactly their
   income. In Shi ([210]1997), the big family assumption is such that each
   family always has income equal to spending. As a result, in these
   frameworks, credit equal to income is enough for money not to
   have value.

An example

   An example helps illustrate how useful money is in this economy. From
   Figure [211]1, it is evident that, given a borrowing limit, monetary
   equilibrium has higher q and lower v (or higher real interest rate
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$1/v-1$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   ) than the nonmonetary equilibrium. Production is also smaller in a
   nonmonetary equilibrium relative to a monetary one: if buyers cannot
   store value in the form of the liquid asset, they choose markets where
   it is inefficiently too easy to buy goods, but this hinders firms'
   ability to sell goods leading to a lower production. To illustrate this
   mechanism and show how poor an allocation can be in a nonmonetary
   equilibrium, Proposition [212]4 covers a special case, when the
   borrowing limit is proportional to end-of-period income,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≡<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;K<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B\equiv \gamma (w+rK)$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   .

   Of special interest is when
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . This is a hedge case with a result that is perhaps surprising: in a
   nonmonetary equilibrium with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , production is zero. The result should become intuitive once one
   recalls what argued in Section [213]2.3, that those in a match must
   spend more than their income for markets to clear when
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . Then, if credit allows each buyer to only spend their end-of-period
   income, a nonmonetary equilibrium must have
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . But this requires
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∞<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta =\infty$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . As a result, firms face
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi =0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and do not demand inputs.[214]41

   The result highlights how dramatically bad the nonmonetary allocation
   can be without enough credit relative to a monetary equilibrium where,
   for the same credit limit, production takes place thanks to the extra
   monetary liquidity. For production to take place in a nonmonetary
   equilibrium, γ must be larger than 1. And if
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there is no nonmonetary equilibrium because the liquidity provided by
   credit is insufficient for an equilibrium without the further liquidity
   provided by money. Intuitively, with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , credit B is always below q so
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;

   m$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   must be positive from ([215]14).

   Proposition 4.Let
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≡<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo

   .

   If

   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma >gt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;

   , there is nonmonetary equilibrium with production.

   If
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma =1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , no production takes place in a nonmonetary equilibrium.

   If
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , there is no nonmonetary equilibrium.

   To paraphrase the result, liquidity (money + credit) must be
   sufficiently large to sustain production. The proposition highlights
   how thirsty of liquidity this economy is. In comparison, in transaction
   models where financial transaction is at most equal to income (e.g.,
   Lucas and Stokey [216]1987 and Svensson [217]1985) with
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≥<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\gamma \ge 1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the economy is saturated with liquidity and there is no
   monetary equilibrium.

Other results

   The model also has many implications that are in common with the new
   monetarist approach. In particular, it can be shown that money is
   neutral but not superneutral, that if B is “lump sum” in the sense that
   it is independent of the households inputs, then credit has no
   implications for the steady state as in GMW. While these results are
   not new, it seems worth mentioning that they hold in this somewhat
   different environment.

3 ACCOUNTING FOR MONETARY AGGREGATES

   In 2020.II, M1 over quarterly GDP was 2.63; the ratio was 3.62 for
   either M2 or M3, and 4.19 for MZM. Furthermore, inside money alone (or
   credit) was larger than GDP. This is because at that time the monetary
   base (or outside money) was equal to 1.02 times GDP. So inside money
   measured, for example, through M2, was
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;2.6<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;3.62<lt;/mn>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1.02<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$2.6=3.62-1.02$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   times quarterly GDP. That money and credit are larger than GDP is not
   just true during the pandemic. Prior the Covid-19 crisis (e.g.,
   2017.III), inside money M2−MB was
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;2.80<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0.79<lt;/mn>gt;
   <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;2.01<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$2.80-0.79=2.01$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   times GDP.[218]42 Is it possible to have monetary equilibrium with so
   much liquidity and when credit alone is larger than transactions? It
   has been shown theoretically that there is monetary equilibrium for any
   bounded credit, so the answer is yes. Below, it is shown briefly how
   the model must be parameterized to match these data.

   In this model,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;M<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m
   M$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   is outside money and B is equal to inside money (a liability of the
   private sector used as a medium of exchange, see Lagos [219]2008), so
   total liquidity, or inside and outside money together, is
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;M<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m M+B$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . From ([220]14),
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;M<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q=p_m M+B$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   .[221]43 Furthermore, from the matching function and the fact that
   sales are equal to GDP,
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;G<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;D<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;P<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =GDP/q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   , so it is possible to parameterize ψ to match the ratio between GDP
   and a measure of total liquidity such as M1, M2, M3, or MZM.[222]44
   Then, it is possible to parameterize B to the amount of inside money to
   match both credit and outside money from ([223]14) so that
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q=p_m m+B$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
   :MATH]
   , where m is the monetary base. Such an equilibrium is monetary because
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;p_m m
   +B=q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   and it has been argued that whenever
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the equilibrium is indeed monetary.

   This procedure shows how to parameterize the model so that there is
   monetary equilibrium with the observed amount of money and credit.
   However, it should be emphasized that this requires to pick the
   probability of finding goods ψ (or the parameters of the matching
   function) accordingly: the smaller ψ, the larger liquidity over output.
   For example, to match a very broad measure such as MZM in 2017, one
   needs
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;G<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;D<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;P<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;
   <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;M<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0.33<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =GDP/(p_m M+B)=0.33$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   . One might worry that the number implies an unrealistically too severe
   search friction. However, not all MZM is as liquid as cash so it seems
   unfair to treat it as the inside money in this paper, which is
   perfectly substitutable to cash. Accordingly, one may find a narrower
   aggregate a more appropriate target, leading to a higher ψ: for
   example, to have
   [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0.9<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
   <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi =0.9$<lt;/annotation>gt;
   <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
   , the monetary aggregate must be 1.1 times quarterly GDP; that number
   lies between M1 and M2 (e.g., M1 and M2 were, respectively, 0.71 and
   2.8 times quarterly GDP in 2017). Furthermore, to match a broad measure
   of money with a milder search friction, one could add search effort (or
   other impediments to spending), thereby inducing a low ψ not because of
   a very low efficiency of the matching function that impedes finding
   spending opportunities, but because of agents' decisions to economize
   on search effort. In quantitative extensions of this model, it would
   also be possible to add goods with very little or no search friction at
   all that are demanded in bounded amounts, such as food and other daily
   needs, or to go in the opposite direction and add financial assets that
   are not as liquid as money, such as government bonds, or even physical
   assets that are as illiquid as housing.

   On top of matching monetary levels, ongoing work suggests that the
   model can also match its movements and offers a promising explanation
   of business cycle fluctuations through the wedge in the matching
   friction. In particular, movements in velocity are notoriously hard to
   match but in a companion paper, Mennuni ([224]2021), it is shown how a
   shock to the matching function moves ψ and therefore GDP over
   liquidity, or velocity. At the same time, a matching shock moves firms'
   matches over production capacity, or measured TFP. The endogenous
   movements in TFP generate the usual real business cycle comovements.
   This way the model accounts for the large movements in velocity,
   capacity utilization, as well as the usual comovements in the real
   variables. That the model accounts for large credit and monetary
   levels, and the business cycle fluctuations of real and monetary
   variables, make it a promising framework for policy analysis.

   Finally, another advantage of this model is that it is possible to
   match monetary aggregates while assuming a shorter length of a period
   such as a day, a week, or a month. A shorter period length than a
   quarter is arguably more appropriate to study monetary issues; the
   relevant period length on which to measure the flow of transactions
   that need to be financed with the existing stock of money is arguably
   fairly short and related to time needed to liquidate the next most
   liquid assets other than money. But in models where credit must be
   smaller than transactions, this is an issue because, in order to have
   monetary equilibrium, it is necessary to take a time horizon such that
   the flow of transactions is larger than the stock of liquidity so that
   the transaction constraint binds. With the data above, this requires a
   period length much larger than a quarter (so that

   is adjusted to account for the smaller flow of transactions. But that
   the matching probability is an increasing function of time is natural
   with a search friction. Similarly to models of labor search where
   unemployment is a stock and job creation and destruction are flows, to
   the extent that the probability of finding goods is proportional to the
   time length of a period, calibration to a shorter period length
   involves equivalent stands on the underlying search friction.

4 CONCLUSIONS

   Motivated by the observed amounts of monetary holdings in times when
   several means of payment do not require to hold liquid funds, this
   paper developed a theory of liquid assets as a way to store unspent
   available funds that emerge because of a search friction in the goods
   market. Monetary equilibrium is consistent with large availabilities of
   credit, which is key to match the levels of broad monetary quantities
   we observe.

   Money also enhances productivity and welfare: when people are less
   worried about not finding goods because they have easy alternative
   means to store value, they search for better deals (lower prices but
   longer queue length) making firms more productive. Put differently, the
   presence of money increases aggregate demand relative to aggregate
   supply. These implications are different than those of other
   monetary models.

   While the story has elements of popular narratives, the framework is
   novel and could have many uses. For instance, here liquidity can be
   extended to a larger set of assets differing in their liquidity
   (captured by the severity of the search friction, which stands for
   differences in information acquisition costs, risk, maturity, etc.)
   reflecting empirical counterparts ranging from government bonds, equity
   shares, and other financial products, to possibly far less liquid
   assets such as houses.[225]45

   Furthermore, this model may help understand further the role of the
   financial sector. In particular, this framework may suggest an
   alternative to the view that the financial crisis and the prolonged
   stagnation are due to credit constraints. In a sense, the large
   literature that exploits credit constraints building on Bernanke and
   Gertler ([226]1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore ([227]1997) works in the
   opposite way to that in this paper. In these models, during recessions
   firms wish to produce more but are constrained. Here instead, firms do
   not wish to produce more because of their difficulties to sell. These
   two channels are possibly both real but have different policy
   implications. In particular, this paper may explain why policies aimed
   at increasing liquidity may not always work. Easing credit conditions
   can be effective in models with credit-constrained firms but it may not
   be as effective in this model where, owing to the matching friction,
   there can be a lack of “appetite” even when there is enough liquidity.

   The framework may also be useful to study fiscal policy, for instance:
   since TFP is affected by the demand–supply ratio, government spending
   could increase TFP.

   Finally, it is well known that in real life, a lot of liquidity is held
   by firms and corporations but in this model all assets are held by the
   household.[228]46 It would be interesting to study an extension of this
   model with a different decentralization where households buy
   consumption goods while firms trade capital subject to severe search
   frictions reflecting low arrival rates of big investment opportunities
   such as takeovers, thereby generating large holdings of liquid assets.
   In this context, households and firms may also prefer different types
   of assets reflecting their different needs for liquidity. Accounting
   for the liquid assets in the hands of firms may also contribute to the
   growing literature that focuses on the macro-economic implications of
   frictions in the production sector, such as Bigio and La'O ([229]2020)
   among others.

     * 1 Generating money holdings through the difficulty to find better
       assets seems consistent with how Warren Buffett recently justified
       Berkshire's large cash holdings: in his 2022 annual letter to
       shareholders, he explained their $144 billion holdings of cash and
       cash equivalents as “a consequence of my failure to find entire
       companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks)
       which meet our criteria for long-term holding.”
     * 2 That money is demanded in excess of average spending is akin to
       the precautionary need for money in Bewley models. However, the
       mechanism and the implications differ. In precautionary models,
       there is no search friction in buying goods but agents defer their
       spending for rainy days. Unlike the precautionary literature, here
       money is robust to insurance: even redistributing goods and money
       to insure against the matching risk, still there is money in excess
       of spending because, owing to the search friction and bilateral
       trading, each individual must carry the liquidity to make the
       initial transaction before redistribution can take place.
       Furthermore, money is robust to the presence of assets that pay
       higher dividends and that can be instantly turned into consumption.
       Instead, in Bewley models, it is necessary to give to money the
       advantage of being more easily turned into goods to buffer
       idiosyncratic shocks: see Wen ([234]2015) (alternatively, it is
       possible to have capital subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic
       shocks directly as in Brunnermeier and Sannikov [235]2016).
     * 3 Wallace ([236]1998) points out that in The Wealth of Nations
       (1776, Book 2, Chap. 2), Smith discussed whether the ability of the
       private sector to issue liabilities that play a role as a medium of
       exchange should be regulated. This issue is up to date given the
       technological advances that favored the introduction of Bitcoin.
       Wallace argues that such a question cannot be convincingly
       addressed in a model where liquid assets are not microfounded.
     * 4 The credit limit can be large but not too large for monetary
       equilibrium: if the credit limit does not bind, it is possible to
       pool all liquid assets and those in a match can spend it all,
       leaving no residual wealth to be stored in money. Under a binding
       credit limit, those in a match cannot borrow enough to spend all
       existing liquid assets.
     * 5 Another difference is that attention is not restricted to the
       “not too tight” borrowing limits as in Alvarez and Jermann
       ([237]2000). Like in Bethune, Hu, and Rocheteau ([238]2018), the
       incentive constraints can also be slack. This way it is possible to
       move the borrowing limit more freely and test the extent to which
       money is robust to credit.
     * 6 It would be also possible to add goods with very little or no
       search friction at all that are demanded in bounded amounts, such
       as food and other daily needs. To the extent that agents do not
       want to spend all their wealth on these goods, the results would
       still go through.
     * 7 The ratio of firms over buyers can also be rearranged as the
       value of supply over demand. So the presence of money increases the
       demand relative to a nonmonetary equilibrium.
     * 8 There is a growing literature with search frictions in the goods
       market and endogenous TFP: examples include Bai, Rull, and
       Storesletten ([239]2019), Huo and Ríos-Rull ([240]2013),
       Petrosky-Nadeau and Wasmer ([241]2011), Den Haan ([242]2014), and
       Ghassibe and Zanetti ([243]2019). The main contribution to this
       literature is to use that mechanism to construct a theory of money.
       This way, it is possible to relate TFP to money velocity.
       Furthermore, Mennuni ([244]2021) shows that disciplining the model
       through monetary quantities has implications for the identification
       of the shocks that drive the business cycle.
     * 9 It would be possible to consider search frictions for the inputs
       markets too. But to isolate the key novelties, the model is kept as
       close as possible to the neoclassical one. However, since capital
       goods are accumulated through final goods, it should be explained
       why capital goods are subject to a search friction in the final
       goods market, but are rented without frictions in the capital input
       market. A possible story is that households have heterogeneous
       storage technologies. But firms, which operate within the period,
       do not have that problem and thus rent any variety of capital.

       goes as follows. In choosing the submarket, buyers face the
       following trade-off: a low p implies a low θ and thus a low ψ. If
       the price is too elastic to θ, a reduction in θ reduces the price
       so much that buyers are likely to choose the submarket with minimum
       price, that is, a corner solution. As shown later,
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$1-\gamma$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       is the elasticity of p to θ. So a high γ ensures a sufficiently low
       elasticity, which in turn ensures convexity of the budget
       constraint and thus an interior solution.
     * 12 A motivation for adopting competitive search is that it does not
       add a bargaining inefficiency, thereby not introducing a further
       element of departure from the neoclassical framework. Furthermore,
       similarly to Menzio, Shi, and Sun ([245]2013), directed search
       brings some tractability because the menu of all possible
       combinations
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt;

       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta ,p,q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       is independent of the wealth distribution. However, because this
       model has capital, it is not fully block recursive, which motivates
       the introduction of insurance later.
     * 13 Bonds do not clear in goods because goods are subject to the
       search friction, so that would make bonds illiquid.
     * 14 Otherwise one could enter a submarket with
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       very large, and then default at the moment of paying. Proof of
       means are commonly required, for example, when booking hotel rooms
       and for traveling visas. Evidence of monetary holdings can be
       provided while remaining anonymous.
     * 15 There are alternative ways to model imperfect record-keeping
       such as to have a fixed cost to access a public record, or to make
       the public record accessible only to a group of the population. I
       followed the approach of Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([246]2013)
       because this way credit is a perfect substitute to money up to the
       borrowing limit.
     * 16 Strictly speaking, this constraint holds at each trading post i,
       not just summing up all trading posts:
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;≤<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;mi>gt;A<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;msubsup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;i<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;α<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msubsup>gt;
       <lt;msubsup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;n<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;i<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;mi>gt;α<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;/msubsup>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta q \le A k_i^\alpha
       n_i^{1-\alpha }$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       for all i. However, because of the constant returns to scale
       production function, summing all trading posts up is without loss
       of generality.
     * 17 It should now be clear why one needs to restrict θ to a compact
       set: if the constraint simply was
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta >gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       , then the problem would have a Sup for
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta =0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       . Some of the propositions later work better if the problem has
       a Max.
     * 18 Households also own the capital stock, which—like firms
       production—could in principle be put on sale in the frictional
       goods market. However, this market does not operate once insurance
       markets are introduced later. Clearly a household would never put
       on sale capital at the same price as the one in which she buys:
       this is because with the proceedings she may not buy back goods for
       the same amount given the search friction, and would hold the rest
       in money, which pays lower return. A household would be willing to
       sell in a submarket with a higher price than the one at which she
       buys, but (in the representative agent environment that follows
       after the introduction of insurance) it would not find anyone
       willing to buy at that same higher price.
     * 19 Since I will introduce insurance markets and Inada conditions in
       the utility function, this constraint is only avoiding Ponzi
       schemes, but it does not induce the sort of precautionary savings
       it would in an incomplete market model à la Aiyagari ([247]1994).
     * 20 This constraint does not bind in equilibrium as
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt;
       <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a^{\prime }=0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       . However, it avoids profitable deviations such as Ponzi schemes.
       Furthermore, the upper bound on
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a^{\prime }$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       avoids the possible deviation of hoarding for some time and
       then defaulting.
     * 21 Without the borrowing limit, it is possible to do even better:
       pool all assets and then let the agents in a match spend it all and
       then redistribute the goods. But this arrangement bypasses the
       credit friction this paper studies, that is, it violates
       Transaction Constraint ([248]6).
     * 22 One could worry that this expedient opens up markets where
       capital of each variety is traded without frictions among
       households that like that variety. This does not happen as there is
       no scope for further exchanges after those prescribed in the
       insurance scheme. This is because after insurance, agents that like
       the same variety value capital and money in the same way and have
       the same amount of both. So, unless the optimal quantity of money
       and capital is indeterminate because agents are indifferent between
       many allocations, they would want to exit the market with the same
       amounts, which can be achieved with no trade. Indifference between
       allocations can be ruled out because, as shown later, the budget
       set is convex and preferences are strictly concave so agents have a
       unique optimum quantity of money and capital in an equilibrium.
     * 23 Submarkets are only indexed with p rather than with
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p,q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       because, as shown in Lemma [249]1, only p matters. The household
       only buys futures from buyers that entered the same submarket p but
       in principle an agent that searches in submarket p could buy
       futures from a household that enters some other submarket
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mover accent="true">gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;̂<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;/mover>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\hat{p}$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
       :MATH]
       . This would complicate the problem and would not improve the
       allocation. To be sure that there are no private incentives to
       trade futures across submarkets, it is enough to assume that
       monitoring with probability
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_f$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       is only possible among agents within the same submarket.

       and B are generic functions because, following Bethune, Hu, and
       Rocheteau ([250]2018), it is possible to have many credit limit
       functions bounded by the not too tight limit described in Alvarez
       and Jermann ([251]2000). The endogenous credit limit may depend on
       the equilibrium because it affects the value of not defaulting, see
       Berentsen, Camera, and Waller ([252]2007), Araujo and Hu
       ([253]2018), Lotz and Zhang ([254]2016), Gomis-Porqueras and
       Sanches ([255]2013), and Section 2.4.1.
     * 25 In this representative agent environment, for intertemporal
       bonds to be in positive supply, they would have to be a liability
       of the government. But since there is no liquidity difference, the
       distinction between money and government bonds would be intangible.
       This can also be appreciated by the first-order conditions for
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt; <lt;annotation

       and

       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$a^{\prime }$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       in Appendix [256]B; they imply an arbitrage Fisher equation that
       pins down v so that money and bonds pay the same return. It would
       be possible to relax the assumption of perfect substitutability and
       distinguish between money and government bonds by assuming a mild
       search friction for bonds. The intertemporal bond highlights that
       this theory of money does not rely on the fact that agents are not
       allowed intertemporal credit. In fact, without insurance, the bond
       would be traded but it would still be in aggregate zero net supply,
       thus leaving space for money demand to store the remaining
       unmatched aggregate savings.
     * 26 It could be argued that in real life one can invest unspent
       funds in shares, which are fairly easy to find. However, shares
       offer a complicated risk/return trade-off that does not suit
       everyone. Furthermore, if one buys shares of firms who hold cash
       (or who hold shares of other firms who hold cash), one is holding
       cash. In this model, agents hold either money or capital directly,
       but one could conceive other decentralizations where firms hold
       capital and money, and issue shares. To make shares less liquid
       than money, one could assume a mild search friction on shares.
     * 27 Capital is introduced in an LW model in GMW, but agents are not
       allowed to consume it or trade it in the decentralized market.
       Lagos and Rocheteau ([257]2008) find conditions under which
       coexistence of money and capital is possible even when capital can
       be used for transactions in the decentralized market. However, they
       assume that capital cannot be directly consumed in the
       decentralized market.
     * 28 In a transaction framework, those are all the effects so that
       agents must be at the margin indifferent between goods and money in
       a centralized market.
     * 29 Without this assumption, a firm could open many trading posts
       and exploit the law of large numbers across them to have production
       capacity only for sales:
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;A<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;msubsup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;

       (\theta (p,q))q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       . Ruling this out implies some excess production capacity and an
       endogenous Solow residual. It is assumed that excess production
       capacity is not storable. This assumption seems reasonable for
       services and nondurables, which form the large majority of GDP. In
       future, it may be interesting to allow for inventories, but to
       match its rich dynamics (e.g., procyclical inventory investment),
       the model should be complicated, for instance, by introducing S-s
       policies or stockout-avoidance motives; see Wen ([258]2011) and
       Bai, Rull, and Storesletten ([259]2019) for a recent analysis.
     * 30 For this one has to show that all other prices (r, w, and
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;annotation

       ) also change proportionally to ξ, so that no relative price is
       changed. It is immediate from equations ([260]21) and ([261]22)
       that given an allocation, r and w are also proportional to ξ.
       Expressions for r and w and p from equations ([262]21), ([263]22),
       and ([264]24) can then be substituted into the budget
       constraints—equations ([265]14) and ([266]16)—to show that
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msub>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/msub>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       is also proportional to ξ. Since no constraint is changed, neither
       will the optimal choices and thus the equilibrium allocation.
     * 31 Following Moen ([267]1997), I assume that if agents are
       indifferent between multiple submarkets, only one will open.
       Furthermore, later I find conditions under which the household's
       problem is concave so that the solution is unique.

       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       , ([268]B3) and ([269]B4), imply an arbitrage condition: because
       bonds and money are equally liquid, they must give the same real
       return. In steady state, the real interest rate on bonds equals the
       inflation rate
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt;

       . This is a Fisher equation with the addition that, owing to the
       perfect substitutability between m and b, the nominal interest rate
       is infinitely elastic at 0. By governing money growth, the
       government sets inflation and v. Equivalently the government can
       set a policy for v and let money supply accommodate money demand.
     * 33 The latter condition implies that the equilibrium p is
       normalized to 1.

       :MATH]
       is needed? Suppose there was only a credit limit B, then one could
       go to a cheap market, get very high q, and then default. One could
       get around this issue by making B function of p and m. Absent the
       limit

       :MATH]
       , B would need to be function of m because a possible deviation is
       to hoard cash, afford a market with high q, and default. However,
       to make m fully observable would require more information than
       showing proof of means: one thing is to show one has a given amount
       of money, another is to prove that that is all the money one has.
     * 35 This is because q is increasing in θ so the constraint on q also
       restricts θ.
     * 36 A Constant Elasticity of substitution matching function
       satisfies these restrictions as long as there is not more
       substitutability than for the Cobb–Douglas case. To restrict
       complementarity above the Cobb–Douglas case seems economically
       meaningful because with more substitutability, one can have matches
       with either only buyers or sellers.
     * 37 For this, the monitoring probabilities must tend to 1 so that
       incentives are satisfied not just for some v, but for any
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v>gt;\beta$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       : absent constraint ([270]13) on q, a deflationary policy may
       violate incentives for given monitoring probabilities because, as
       shown next, it implies high q, thereby increasing the temptation to
       default on the ToT. That deflationary policies are limited by
       imperfect monitoring is reminiscent of Andolfatto ([271]2013).
     * 38 It should be noted that q is larger than transactions, which are
       equal to
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
       :MATH]
       and always bounded. That
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∞<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q\rightarrow
       \infty$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       when
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;v<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;→<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;β<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v \rightarrow
       \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       would not hold if one added search costs proportional to q.
     * 39 It should be noticed that the constrained efficient allocation
       with the incentive constraints may involve some inflation as in
       Araujo and Hu ([272]2018). Optimal monetary policy is left for
       future research. Next, I characterize the decentralized economy.
     * 40 To see why all aggregate income is spent via credit when agents
       borrow q, rewrite ([273]26) as
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo
       linebreak="badbreak">gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo linebreak="goodbreak">gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
       <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mo
       linebreak="goodbreak">gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo linebreak="goodbreak">gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
       <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mfrac>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt;
       <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mfrac>gt; <lt;mo>gt;.<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$$\begin{equation*}q=(w+rk)+(w+rk)\fra
       c{1-\psi }{\psi }.\end{equation*}$$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
       :MATH]
       By borrowing q, each agent borrows against her own income
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;n<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt;
       <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$wn+rk$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt;
       :MATH]
       plus all the income of the unmatched
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt;
       <lt;mo>gt;−<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
       <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$(1-\psi )(w+rk)$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       , divided by the number of matched agents ψ. When
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;B<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       , it is still the case that all income must be spent in
       equilibrium. Money gives to the agents in a match the purchasing
       power to spend for the income of the agents not in a match.
     * 41 Why do not agents choose a submarket with
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;∞<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\theta
       <lt;\infty$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       so that
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ϕ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;>gt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;0<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\phi >gt;0$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       and firms can produce? This would reduce the chance to be in a
       match ψ but at least, once in a match agents would buy something.
       The problem is that once in a match, for markets to clear, they
       would need to spend
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;r<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;
       <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mo>gt;/<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation
       encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$pq=(w+rk)/\psi$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       , which with
       [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt;
       <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt;
       <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH]
       is larger than B, so they cannot afford it (and they cannot
       renegotiate the ToT). There are incentives to produce once at a
       trading post but competitive search assumes commitment to the ToT
       determined before the match, nomatter the ex post incentives (this
       commitment is endogenously enforced with enough monitoring as
       discussed in Section 2.4.1). Furthermore, the input markets open
       before the goods market so inputs are predetermined at the matching
       state and if firms did not hire, there cannot be production.
     * 42 The data on the monetary stocks come from the Board of Governors
       of the Federal Reserve System (United States), retrieved from FRED,
       Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis on February 24, 2021.
     * 43 Equation ([274]14) is always binding in a monetary equilibrium
       outside the Friedman rule.
     * 44 As done in Mennuni ([275]2021), one should calibrate the
       parameters of the matching function so that the equilibrium ψ is
       the desired one. But many functional forms can be calibrated to
       give the desired equilibrium value.
     * 45 An attractive feature is that liquidity premia are endogenous:
       agents choose assets trading off their liquidity and their return
       so that in equilibrium the more liquid the asset the lower
       its return.
     * 46 To get a sense of the magnitudes, the NYT Magazine reported in
       2016 that with its liquidity, Google alone could buy outright
       companies of the likes of Uber, Goldman Sachs, or American Express
       (Davidson [276]2016). Overall, data from the Federal Reserve
       flow-of-funds show that in 2016, American businesses had $1.9
       trillion in “cash.” That is about 40% of quarterly U.S. GDP.

What Is Money?

   Finance &amp; Development, September 2012, Vol. 49, No. 3

   [17]Irena Asmundson and Ceyda Oner

   Without it, modern economies could not function
   What Is Money?

   Money may make the world go around, as the song says. And most people
   in the world probably have handled money, many of them on a daily
   basis. But despite its familiarity, probably few people could tell you
   exactly what money is, or how it works.

   In short, money can be anything that can serve as a
   • store of value, which means people can save it and use it
       later—smoothing their purchases over time;
       • unit of account, that is, provide a common base for prices; or
       • medium of exchange, something that people can use to buy and sell
       from one another.

       IFRAME: [18]http://www.youtube.com/embed/FpMB0Qhnp7E

   Perhaps the easiest way to think about the role of money is to consider
   what would change if we did not have it.

   If there were no money, we would be reduced to a barter economy. Every
   item someone wanted to purchase would have to be exchanged for
   something that person could provide. For example, a person who
   specialized in fixing cars and needed to trade for food would have to
   find a farmer with a broken car. But what if the farmer did not have
   anything that needed to be fixed? Or what if a farmer could only give
   the mechanic more eggs than the mechanic could reasonably use? Having
   to find specific people to trade with makes it very difficult to
   specialize. People might starve before they were able to find the right
   person with whom to barter.

   But with money, you don’t need to find a particular person. You just
   need a market in which to sell your goods or services. In that market,
   you don’t barter for individual goods. Instead you exchange your goods
   or services for a common medium of exchange—that is, money. You can
   then use that money to buy what you need from others who also accept
   the same medium of exchange. As people become more specialized, it is
   easier to produce more, which leads to more demand for transactions
   and, hence, more demand for money.

Many monies

   To put it a different way, money is something that holds its value over
   time, can be easily translated into prices, and is widely accepted.
   Many different things have been used as money over the years—among
   them, cowry shells, barley, peppercorns, gold, and silver.

   At first, the value of money was anchored by its alternative uses, and
   the fact that there were replacement costs. For example, you could eat
   barley or use peppercorns to flavor food. The value you place on such
   consumption provides a floor for the value. Anyone could grow more, but
   it does take time, so if the barley is eaten the supply of money
   declines. On the other hand, many people may want strawberries and be
   happy to trade for them, but they make poor money because they are
   perishable. They are difficult to save for use next month, let alone
   next year, and almost impossible to use in trade with people far away.
   There is also the problem of divisibility—not everything of value is
   easily divided, and standardizing each unit is also tricky; for
   example, the value of a basket of strawberries measured against
   different items is not easy to establish and keep constant. Not only do
   strawberries make for bad money, most things do.

   But precious metals seemed to serve all three needs: a stable unit of
   account, a durable store of value, and a convenient medium of exchange.
   They are hard to obtain. There is a finite supply of them in the world.
   They stand up to time well. They are easily divisible into standardized
   coins and do not lose value when made into smaller units. In short,
   their durability, limited supply, high replacement cost, and
   portability made precious metals more attractive as money than other
   goods.

   Until relatively recently, gold and silver were the main currency
   people used. Gold and silver are heavy, though, and over time, instead
   of carrying the actual metal around and exchanging it for goods, people
   found it more convenient to deposit precious metals at banks and buy
   and sell using a note that claimed ownership of the gold or silver
   deposits. Anyone who wanted to could go to the bank and get the
   precious metal that backs the note. Eventually, the paper claim on the
   precious metal was delinked from the metal. When that link was broken,
   fiat money was born. Fiat money is materially worthless, but has value
   simply because a nation collectively agrees to ascribe a value to it.
   In short, money works because people believe that it will. As the means
   of exchange evolved, so did its source—from individuals in barter, to
   some sort of collective acceptance when money was barley or shells, to
   governments in more recent times.

   Even though using standardized coins or paper bills made it easier to
   determine prices of goods and services, the amount of money in the
   system also played an important role in setting prices. For example, a
   wheat farmer would have at least two reasons for holding money: to use
   in transactions (cash in advance) and as a buffer against future needs
   (precautionary saving). Suppose winter is coming and the farmer wants
   to add to his store of money in anticipation of future expenses. If the
   farmer has a hard time finding people with money who want to buy wheat,
   he may have to accept fewer coins or bills in exchange for the grain.
   The result is that the price of wheat goes down because the supply of
   money is too tight. One reason might be that there just isn’t enough
   gold to mint new money. When prices as a whole go down, it is called
   deflation. On the other hand, if there is more money in circulation but
   the same level of demand for goods, the value of the money will drop.
   This is inflation—when it takes more money to get the same amount of
   goods and services (see “[20]What Is Inflation?” in the March 2010
   issue of F&amp;D). Keeping the demand for and supply of money balanced can
   be tricky.

Manufacturing money

   How money is measured

   Fiat money is more efficient to use than precious metals. Adjustments
   to its supply do not depend on the amount of precious metal around. But
   that adds its own complication: Precisely because there is a finite
   amount of precious metals, there is a limit on the amount of notes that
   can be issued. If there is no gold or silver to back money, how do
   governments know how much to print? That gets into the dilemmas
   governments face. On the one hand, the authorities will always be
   tempted to issue money, because governments can buy more with it, hire
   more people, pay more wages, and increase their popularity. On the
   other hand, printing too much money starts to push up prices. If people
   start expecting that prices will continue to rise, they may increase
   their own prices even faster. Unless the government acts to rein in
   expectations, trust in money will be eroded, and it may eventually
   become worthless. That is what happens during hyperinflation. To remove
   this temptation to print money willy-nilly, most countries today have
   delegated the task of deciding how much money to print to independent
   central banks, which are charged with making the call based on their
   assessment of the economy’s needs and do not transfer funds to the
   government to finance its spending (see “[21]What Is Monetary Policy?”
   in the September 2009 issue of F&amp;D). The term “printing money” is
   something of a misnomer in itself. Most money today is in the form of
   bank deposits rather than paper currency (see box).

Belief can fade

   Countries that have been down the path of high inflation experienced
   firsthand how the value of money essentially depends on people
   believing in it. In the 1980s, people in some Latin American countries,
   such as Argentina and Brazil, gradually lost confidence in the
   currency, because inflation was eroding its value so rapidly. They
   started using a more stable one, the U.S. dollar, as the de facto
   currency. This phenomenon is called unofficial, or de facto,
   dollarization. The government loses its monopoly on issuing money—and
   dollarization can be very difficult to reverse.

   Some policies governments have used to restore confidence in a currency
   nicely highlight the “faith” part of money functioning. In Turkey, for
   example, the government rebased the currency, the lira, eliminating six
   zeros in 2005. Overnight, 1,000,000 liras became 1 lira. Brazil, on the
   other hand, introduced a new currency in 1994, the real. In both
   countries, citizens went along, demonstrating that as long as everyone
   accepts that a different denomination or a new currency is the norm, it
   simply will be. Just like fiat money. If it is accepted as money, it is
   money. ■

     * [26]Praise

   Parents everywhere want their children to be happy and do well. Yet how
   parents seek to achieve this ambition varies enormously. For instance,
   American and Chinese parents are increasingly authoritative and
   authoritarian, whereas Scandinavian parents tend to be more permissive.
   Why? Love, Money, and Parenting investigates how economic forces and
   growing inequality shape how parents raise their children. From
   medieval times to the present, and from the United States, the United
   Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden to China and Japan, Matthias
   Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how economic incentives and
   constraints—such as money, knowledge, and time—influence parenting
   practices and what is considered good parenting in different countries.
   Through personal anecdotes and original research, Doepke and Zilibotti
   show that in countries with increasing economic inequality, such as the
   United States, parents push harder to ensure their children have a path
   to security and success. Economics has transformed the hands-off
   parenting of the 1960s and ’70s into a frantic, overscheduled activity.
   Growing inequality has also resulted in an increasing “parenting gap”
   between richer and poorer families, raising the disturbing prospect of
   diminished social mobility and fewer opportunities for children from
   disadvantaged backgrounds. In nations with less economic inequality,
   such as Sweden, the stakes are less high, and social mobility is not
   under threat. Doepke and Zilibotti discuss how investments in early
   childhood development and the design of education systems factor into
   the parenting equation, and how economics can help shape policies that
   will contribute to the ideal of equal opportunity for all.
   Love, Money, and Parenting presents an engrossing look at the economics
   of the family in the modern world.

Awards and Recognition

     * A Fatherly Top Ten Best Parenting Book of the Decade
     * A Choice Outstanding Academic Title of the Year

   Matthias Doepke is professor of economics at Northwestern University.
   He lives in Evanston, Illinois. Fabrizio Zilibotti is the Tuntex
   Professor of International and Development Economics at Yale
   University. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.

   "Psychologists, sociologists and journalists have spent more than a
   decade diagnosing and critiquing the habits of ‘helicopter parents’ and
   their school obsessions. . . . But new research shows that in our
   unequal era, this kind of parenting is essential. That’s the message of
   the book Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We
   Raise Our Kids, by the economists Matthias Doepke of Northwestern
   University and Fabrizio Zilibotti of Yale. It’s true that high-octane,
   hardworking child-rearing has some pointless excesses, and it doesn’t
   spark joy for parents. But done right, it works for kids, not just in
   the United States but in rich countries around the world."—Pamela
   Druckerman, New York Times

   "An incisive look at parenting and economic inequality."—Carolyn Dever,
   Public Books

   "Why do so many seemingly sane people get over-involved with their
   kids? The answer is not that parents have collectively come unhinged,
   according to the new book Love, Money and Parenting: How Economics
   Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids. Rather, parents today are rational
   economic actors responding to an increasingly unhinged
   environment."—Jenny Anderson, Quartz

   "An earnest tilt at a genuinely hard question: To what degree are
   parental choices informed by economic realities? Reducing his answer to
   a single line is reductive, but let’s do it anyway. When it comes to
   raising Americans kids, it’s the economy, stupid."—Patrick A. Coleman,
   Fatherly.com

   "As economists Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti reveal in their
   recent book Love, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way
   We Raise Our Kids, today’s American parents are not so crazy after all.
   For better and worse, their parenting style is perfectly rational."—Kay
   Hymowitz, Institute for Family Studies

   "All in all, a highly informative read."—David Lorimer, Paradigm
   Explorer

   "The book introduces stimulating ideas in an accessible manner."—John
   Ermisch, Journal of Economic Inequality

   "N/A"—Alexandra Martynenko, Antropologicheskij Forum

   “Love, Money, and Parenting presents a fascinating, insightful analysis
   of the origins and consequences of different parenting styles over time
   and place. Doepke and Zilibotti explain how and why parents shape child
   preferences and skills to adapt their offspring to the anticipated
   social and economic realities facing them as adults. The authors
   creatively use basic economic theory to integrate and interpret a vast
   body of evidence from multiple disciplines. This ambitious, well-argued
   book carefully examines how families influence the social and economic
   fortunes of their children.”—James J. Heckman, Nobel Laureate in
   Economics

   “Economics is usually the last thing on people's minds when they think
   about parenting. This wonderfully readable and original book aims to
   change that. It shows how different parenting styles are all about
   trade-offs, how they shape the way children explore and experiment with
   the world and take risks, and how economic factors have played an
   important role in the striking changes we have experienced in the way
   parents think about their children and parent them. A must-read.”—Daron
   Acemoglu, coauthor of Why Nations Fail

   “In their stimulating account of the reasons behind different parenting
   practices, Doepke and Zilibotti unashamedly argue for an economic
   interpretation, while also including social and cultural factors.
   Worryingly, the authors show how emerging societal divisions could
   enable some parents to promote their children even as they disable the
   efforts of parents in more difficult economic circumstances. Parenting
   regimes by class threaten equal opportunities, social mobility, and
   political participation. The authors’ hope is that thoughtful policy
   interventions can head off such threats.” —Jane Humphries, author of
   Childhood and Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution

   “Presenting many key findings and novel explanations, Love, Money, and
   Parenting argues that we can use economic principles to explain why
   different parenting styles exist across different countries and within
   countries at any given point in time. At once intelligent,
   sophisticated, and accessible, there is no other book that tackles the
   same themes as this one. I really enjoyed reading it.”—Nattavudh
   Powdthavee, author of The Happiness Equation

   “Bringing together personal experiences, reasoning, and evidence, this
   fascinating and persuasive book shows that parenting decisions are
   governed by incentives and an economic approach can help us to
   understand why parents’ choices might vary across countries and over
   time. The wealth of information, detail, and strength of economic
   argument is impressive.”—Jo Blanden, coauthor of The Persistence of
   Poverty across Generations

Money Advice Scotland featured in BBC Disclosure: The Debt Dealers

   BBC Scotland’s programme Disclosure – The Debt Dealers features Money
   Advice Scotland’s Training Development Lead, Ged Mulvey, who spoke to
   reporter Sam Poling about the impact of being in the wrong debt
   solution. The programme focuses on the trust deed market in Scotland,
   and in particular how some providers advertise and sign up clients.

   Ged Mulvey said: “For the right person, a trust deed can absolutely be
   the right solution and there are some great trust deed providers out
   there.

   “However, our concern is that someone who would have been better suited
   to another debt solution can end up in a trust deed. Because clients
   will pay fees to their trust deed provider and these are typically paid
   more at the start, if the trust deed fails due to a client being unable
   to maintain payments (indicating it was not the most appropriate
   solution in the first place), they can find themselves back in their
   original position with their debt outstanding but having paid
   significant fees to their trust deed provider – as we see with
   Cassandra who is featured in the programme. She should have never been
   in a trust deed based on her circumstances.”

   The programme also discusses the FCA’s upcoming intervention in this
   market with its ban on debt packagers (third parties who receive a
   referral fee from passing a client to a trust deed provider). However,
   this does not completely mitigate the risk of clients going into a
   trust deed when it is not the best option for them; as we see in the
   programme, many trust deed providers use social media and digital
   advertising to target people and encourage them to get in touch, with
   no third party referrer needed.

   The programme highlights the importance of the free money advice sector
   in Scotland, where organisations like Christians Against Poverty and
   StepChange (both featured) and others such as Citizens Advice Bureaux,
   local authorities, and other free-to-client money advice agencies can
   assess each client’s individual circumstances to determine which option
   will be best for them in helping them with their debt.

   For more information on where to access free advice, [59]visit our
   website.

   Disclosure – The Debt Dealers airs on BBC 1 Scotland at 8pm Monday
   19^th June and BBC Iplayer.

Money transfer

   Hello, I have some saving accounts in France and I do have to fill up a
   self assessment in order to pay my taxes on the interests in the UK. If
   I wanted to transfer some money from my French bank account to my
   English bank account, do I have to declare or mention it somewhere?
   Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of money I am transferring to
   the Uk? And what is the maximum amount I can transfer in one go? Thank
   you

   Hi,
   In terms of income tax this would not need to be declared.
   We would only look to tax interest from a bank account, and this has
   already been declared.
   In terms of how much you can tranfer, you would need to speak to your
   bank regarding this.

   I have similar issue, transferred a loan from my business account (
   sole trader not limited) to my personal. Do it affect my self assesment
   next year? Thanks

   Hi,
   Where your business loan is kept will not affect any tax return unless
   you accrue interest on it. In which case you will need to declare this
   to us.

   I’m a Canadian citizen, resident in the UK and wish to transfer monies
   from Canada to the UK. The money was left to me by my late mother and
   relevant taxes have been paid in Canada. It’s not income so I can’t see
   that I’d need to pay income tax on the UK on it ? Would this be correct
   please ? Thanks in advance. Joe.

   Hello.
   There are no income tax implications with you moving Capital from one
   bank to another.
   The interest you receive from the accounts are taxable income.
   Thank You.

   I am an international student (Taiwanese) who has already lived in the
   UK for two years. I would like to buy a house in the UK for my
   university journey, my father’s ex-business partner is willing to lend
   me around £400K (interest-free) from Singapore. Before receiving £400K
   from Singapore, I would like to ask some questions and hope somebody
   can give me some suggestions: (1) As a non-UK citizen, could I use the
   borrowed money for the property purchase? (cash buyer) (2) If I can use
   the borrowed money for the property purchase, do I need to declare the
   large money transaction with HMRC? Like tax paying. Big thanks

   Hi, I am a Malaysian and will move to UK soon to star a new job. I have
   never worked in UK before and all my current savings are from prior
   work in other countries with income tax paid and tax filing done. Do I
   need to declare such transfer with HMRC and will it be subject for any
   tax? Thank you!

   Hello Xiang Li.

   For income tax purposes, you do not need to  notify us of your Capital
   your bank account or if you transfer your money to a UK account.
   Thank You.

   Good morning. My father who has a savings account in one UK bank is
   planning on transfering money to my account in another UK bank, and
   neither of these accounts are joint accounts (I am not in his accound
   and he is not in mine). Will he or myself have to pay any taxes on that
   transfer? If so, is there a limit in the money transfered above which I
   will get taxed? Thanks for your help in advance.

   Hello - I moved to the UK just over five months ago. I've been renting
   an apartment with my wife and children since November. And working for
   a UK-based company since Oct. I have money held in a foreign account
   and would like to transfer the sums into my UK accounts. Do I need to
   notify HMRC about this transfer? This is money I have saved from
   previous jobs before moving to the UK. Thank you.

   Hi taimmah,
   There is no income tax implications when you change capital from one
   bank account to another.
   You may wish to check with the overseas tax authorities if  you need to
   notify them and you may wish to contact your bank to check if any
   deails are needed there.
   Thank you.

   Hello, I am just arrived at the UK. I am arranging to move money from
   my overseas accounts to the UK. Part of the money moving in will be
   used towards the purchase of a residential house for my son in the UK.
   He is currently a non-resident and will be a tax-resident in the year
   2021-2022. Need my son or I pay UK tax for the money transfer? Does it
   require for any declaration of the transfer to the HMRC? Will there be
   any difference if the money transfer between our accounts (UK accounts)
   occur before and after financial year cut-off of 5April2021? Thank you.

   The federal agency that administers Social Security benefits is making
   new efforts to reclaim overpayments, and it may try to claw back money
   if you’ve been receiving too much.

   About 1 million people per year received overpayment notices from the
   Social Security Administration (SSA) in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years,
   Kilolo Kijakazi, acting commissioner of the SSA, said in recent
   testimony to Congresss. The agency began a "top-to-bottom" [176]review
   of overpayment issues last month, Kijakazi said.

   Roughly 0.5% of Social Security payments are overpayments, according to
   the agency. Overpayments can either be the government’s fault or the
   result of a mistake by the beneficiary. Either way, the result is that
   beneficiaries owe money back to the government.

   A new [177]60 Minutes report found that some overpaid Social Security
   recipients have been told they need to pay back tens of thousands of
   dollars. For example, a 73-year-old woman told the program she was
   notified that she owed $72,000 in overpayments because her benefits
   were based on incorrect salary information.

Government to track down Social Security overpayments

   It is unclear how much money the government is trying to collect in
   Social Security overpayments. Officials denied that the agency is
   trying to collect $21 billion in Social Security overpayments, as some
   media reports suggested.

   "This figure was derived from the total amount of overpayments that
   have occurred over the history of the programs," the SSA explained in a
   [179]statement last month. "Each person’s situation is unique, and the
   agency handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis."

   The news of the overpayment review could be concerning for Social
   Security beneficiaries who are unsure if they are being paid the
   correct amount — or for anyone who suspects their checks are larger
   than they should be.

   The SSA said the overpayment problem occurs "given the number of people
   the agency serves, the number of changes in their circumstances and the
   complexity of the program."[DEL: :DEL]

   The SSA collected $4.7 billion in overpaid Social Security in 2022, per
   an inspector general report. (The agency notes that Social Security
   benefits total $1.4 trillion per year.)

   Social Security benefits help supplement income in retirement for 70
   million recipients. The annual [180]cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)
   was 8.7% in 2023 based on high inflation, bringing benefits to about
   $1,700 per month on average. Another [181]3.2% increase in payments is
   slated for 2024.

What happens if you were paid too much in Social Security

   If you've been overpaid, it's possible to get on a plan to repay the
   government gradually. However, according to [182]KFF Health News, these
   plans are stressing the budgets of some affected beneficiaries as the
   agency is collecting from "poor, retired, and disabled people who have
   spent the money and are unable to repay it."

   When someone is overpaid Social Security, years could pass before the
   issue is detected, and by that time the mistake may have amounted to a
   massive sum, according to the health news publication.

   The government is required by law to try to recover Social Security
   overpayments, officials said, but recovery can be waived in some
   scenarios.

   You can file an appeal or make a request that the Social Security
   Administration not seek the money back. The agency also said it’s
   working to reduce overpayments in the future and make relief more
   accessible to overpaid beneficiaries seeking waivers.

How to avoid Social Security overpayments

   Experts are encouraging Social Security beneficiaries to calculate how
   much they should be getting paid to see if it aligns with their
   benefits. Doing this calculation can reduce the chances of a surprise
   overpayment notice from the SSA.

   The AARP has an online tool that can help you [183]estimate your
   benefits. You can also access your [184]"my Social Security" account to
   check if the information the agency has on file is accurate. Benefits
   are partially based on the Social Security taxes you've paid in your
   lifetime, so it's important to make sure the earnings history is
   accurate.

   If you have a government pension, your Social Security benefits can be
   more complicated to calculate. According to 60 Minutes, there's a risk
   of overpayment if you don't properly report your pension information to
   Social Security.

   Working disabled people should also be aware of the income limit for
   Social Security, which is $1,470 per month in most cases. Overpayments
   can be avoided by promptly notifying the SSA of changes in your
   employment or your income.

Profits Using Profits Maximiser Programme

How to Become a Betfair Scalper is a Betfair method that uses a scalping
technique to scrape profits from all the horse races before the races have
even begin. It is claimed that you can make excellent profits.


   From Home Business Direct (homebusinessdirect.co.uk) Using your
   computer, you will be taught how to take advantage of how much money is
   entering the Betfair market at specific times BEFORE an event. Using
   the fact that most people who use Betfair have no idea what they are
   doing, users of Betfair Scalper will be able to set ‘traps’ to
   manipulate where the money is going, and then consistently make
   multiple profits throughout the day, without anybody even noticing.
   What you will be doing, is scalping, or creaming a percentage of the
   money being placed BEFORE an event has even taken place.

How does Betfair Scalper work?

   The product is a detailed video tutorial, together with an in-depth
   manual that will teach users how to set a method up whereby profits can
   be made before an event, say a horse race, football match, has even
   taken place. Using specific software from a Windows computer (a
   computer is needed Betfair Scalper Review Online Now for this, not a
   tablet, remember to make more professional, you must act
   professionally, and a tablet will not cut it for this!).

   Scalping on Betfair is not new, but we have yet to find such a
   comprehensive training course that can, and will take users by the hand
   and teach them everything they need to know.

   This Betfair scalping product includes complete video examples on how
   to make profits, how to set everything up, what to do when things go
   wrong (and they sometimes do, in all trading), as well deciding if you
   actually enjoy generating revenue this way.

   Scalping works by entering trades before the horse races begin, and
   then using methods, you will be scraping small profits from the
   liquidity entering the market before the main activity starts, and
   definitely before the race begins.

   Scalping is quite a relaxed way of making money compared to many of the
   systems out there. It is simply a case of time that you have to invest
   after you learn how it is done.

Contents of The Betfair Scalping Course?

   You gain access to the scalping members area that teaches you from the
   very beginning, even if you are new to trading. The sections are
   detailed into the following:
     * Start Here

     * Betangel Use

     * Basic Scalping Profits

     * Member Feedback

     * Advanced Scalping

     * Further Trading

     * Latest Information

   The course contains over 7+ hours of HD video content that is aimed at
   teaching you how to trade the markets, and the Betfair Exchanges to a
   point of making a profit.

   The first videos on the course teach you all about the mindset needed,
   what to expect from the course, how to use the software, the settings,
   and then the very basics you need to get started, and then you have a
   section on the actual strategies, and scalping signals you will be
   using to take advantage and profit.

   There is also a members section where feedback and emails/questions are
   shared with other members using videos, which digs into the actual
   detail of some of the more not obvious questions.

   Then later on in the course, there is a video section on advanced
   trading to further increase your profits. These also include taking
   races in play on Betfair, and increasing profit on top of what you have
   already made, which is taught as being risk free.

Some Betfair Scalper Videos From Youtube:

                                      .

Initial investment of Betfair Scalper?

   £89.97 – Although when considering how much the investment is, as
   always, you will need to weigh up the earning potential of what is
   being offered, as well as the money back guarantee offered by the
   vendor. There are many Betfair products online that don’t come anywhere
   near to the quality that this scalping course offers, and continues to
   be increased almost daily.

   What you should also consider, is the amount of products you have
   probably purchased over the years that have not worked, and then
   consider the true value of a product and course that does work. Also
   remember that there is a LOT of content contained in this course and a
   lot of instruction with well over 7 hours of video tutorials filmed in
   HD format for quality viewing.

   The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for this products, which
   we believe makes it a snip at the price.

What is the rate of return?

   The rate of return is advertised as the user making up to £40 , £50+
   per day, depending on their betting bank. Although new users can expect
   to make upwards of £30 per day with reasonable stakes when they have
   learned how to scalp efficiently.


   betfair scalper and Scalping profits


   The course also teaches you how to scale the profits up when you have
   practiced enough and have enough experience. This will be the same for
   any type of trading product in that you have to elarn the process
   first, learn how the trading works, and then find a style that suits
   you based on that same experience.

   There are now reports and screenshots of members making upwards of
   £100+ per day as you can see from the image on the right which is a
   customer who sent in a screenshot of their profits from their Betfair
   account

   Scalping is a very good way of producing profits on a daily basis when
   you have learned how it works, as you are taking small amounts of money
   from the betting exchanges on every race, so it is really is up to you
   as to how much time you wish to spend doing this.

   We have probably produced more reviews than anything else on the topic
   of Betfair, and some are amusingly bad in their execution, but some are
   far better than others at explaining the concepts and strategies needed
   when trying to make a profit from Betfair, and this is one of them
   without a doubt.

How Much Money Do I Need To Start?

   The website states that you can actually start with a low betting bank
   and then increase this same betting bank with your profits. It also
   states that you can specify and choose particular races based around
   the betting banks. The following video explains this further:

   course:

   Some great comments from users, as you can see from above.

Will The Betfair Scalper Course Work For Me?

   Trading is not for everybody, it takes time, dedication and a
   willingness to prepare yourself for what is required in order to follow
   a strict training plan.

   That said, compared to some of the outrageous claims made online for
   other products, scalping is one product that simply does work, and does
   not take that much investment to get started. You will of course need
   to be prepared to put some real effort in, but the returns are there.

   Many people make a profit from Betfair this way, so as long as you put
   the time in then there is no reason it cannot work for you. You will
   not be a fully experienced Betfair trader after watching all the
   videos, sure you will know what to do, but then you have to practice
   what you will have learned and spend the time it takes to learn all
   about the signals and as the course states a lot: practice.

   There are many claiming that it is one of the best Betfair trading
   courses brought to market, and we would agree with that assumption.

Conclusion on The Betfair Scalping Course

   This is an excellent product, and as long as you have a Windows
   computer, then together with the money back guarantee, you have nothing
   to lose really. Remember though, that as with any trading opportunity,
   you can only make money if you have the time to dedicate yourself to
   what is being taught.

   The teachings in the video course are clear, concise and extremely
   detailed regarding how to make a profit from Betfair, and the emails we
   get back on the product and Betfair Scalper course have a common theme,
   in that customers love the course and the way it is laid out.

Where Can I Buy The Scalping Course?

   The price is also on £89.97 –  and relatively cheap at the price for
   the quality course materials you gain access to.

   Dear Members,

   We have been present, and involved in testing the product over the last
   few months, and we must say, this looks to be one of the easiest, and
   most low risk, low pressure trading/gambling methods we have ever come
   across.

   We have videoed 11 trades using this over the last 2 days, and there
   have been 10 wins and 1 loss, with a profit margin of £63.83. This has
   represented a profit of £5.80 per race traded, and when you consider
   that there are approximately 20 races per day in the UK and Ireland,
   that could be a potential profit of £41,000+ per year.

   Time is needed to generate the profits with this, but the upside is
   that there is virtually no pressure as the betting bank is never at
   risk.

   To give a quick example, the profits made over the last 2 days were:

   Race 1: £5.13 won
   Race 2: £5.60 won
   Race 3: £5.95 won
   Race 4: £7.78 won
   Race 5: £6.40 lost
   Race 6: £4.01 won
   Race 7: £10.86 won
   Race 8: £5.17 won
   Race 9: £7.79 won
   Race 10: £4.74 won
   Race 11: £12.80 won

   The profits represented a yearly increase on the betting bank of over
   1,600%, which the author stated was an average figure for his students
   when following these scalping methods – now try getting that in
   interest from your bank!

   There is also no chasing losses, or particular staking plan, due to the
   low risk. How much profit is made is directly linked to the amount of
   betting bank available, but as already mentioned the betting bank is
   never at risk.

   The product is a complete video training course, together with detailed
   manual amongst the video, on how to make these daily profits using
   Betfair.

   We are very excited by this one, to add to our other guaranteed ways to
   generate an online income.

   Regards,

   Admin.

   Hello Everybody,

   Just to let you all know that the Betfair Scalping product was actually
   launched a few months ago, and contains around 7 hours of video
   tutorials on how to follow scalping, and how to make profits this way.

   The product has been very well received so far.

   How much time does doing this take up and can you do this if you have a
   full time job working 9-5, or do you need to be available to place bets
   etc right before races start??

   Probably. It’s a professional course teaching you a method that is
   dependent on the market and not dependent on a specific software, so
   you would need a trading software (any) that has the “enchanced ladder”
   mode, and all trading softwares have it. You would probably have no
   problem if you use, for example, Geeks Toy.

   Betangel is by far the most preferred by professionals, and the most
   detailed, that’s why they are using it, and it is truly magnificent.

   Good luck in your trading journey.

   Hello Ian,

   Good question.

   Scalping is about profiting from 1 or more positions, and therefore the
   stake needed is higher than a direct bet, BUT, the stake is never at
   risk, due to the fact all the scalping is done before play.

   For example, a stake of £300 may be required to make, say £5 inside a
   few minutes, but that £300 is never at risk, all we are doing is
   ‘using’ the weight of the bank, as a means to an end – profit, not
   risking the bank.

   If you are familiar with Betfair you will know that if laying a trade,
   for example, even before play, that Betfair will take the liability for
   once the race has concluded, but because the races never ever go in
   play, we do not risk the bank – ever.

   Basically, no matter what size betting bank somebody has, profits can
   be made. The higher the bank the higher the profits, but with say a 5%
   compounded profit per day even the smallest of betting banks would
   quickly become substantial in a small period of time.

   We have been testing this ourselves, and are very impressed with the
   results. The only variable we have found that is not in the user’s
   control is the odds on certain horses, but that is not even an issue,
   because the stakes can be increased to compensate, and again, as the
   bank is never at risk, there is even some degree of control to that
   also.

   Admin.

   Hi Guys, how subjective is the method, does it tell you which race,
   horse, entry and exit points?Must say it looks very consistent.Does it
   only work on horses or can it be used on other sports as well?
   Many thanks

   Hi again, Ian.

   It is fairly subjective. There are definite entry and exit points, and
   what we are finding is that approximately 8 times out of 10 the profits
   are fairly easy, and just happens almost to the letter, and the other 2
   times are what we have started calling ‘variable’ trades as it takes a
   little longer to gain the profit, but yes, the win-to-lose ratio is
   highly stacked in the favour of the scalping method.

   Without giving the information away ( which could also confuse ) the
   scalping method entails laying ‘traps’ in the market around 10 minutes
   before the race when the market is fairly static and then capitalising
   before the start of each race when the liquidity (money) floods into
   the market creating movement on the price.

   Hi,

   Stuart is one of the best trainers I have come across in a long while.
   It taught me how to use the software also, which I needed, and steadily
   making some money with it after learning it all. Just one thing I would
   like to say. There is a LOT of videos and learning to do but it is all
   done in a nice way, I really enjoyed the videos. Start small and then
   increase that is what I did and it is working really well for me know.

   In the last 7 days I have made profits of about £280 after Betfair
   takes their 5% from me so I am pleased. I will stick with the same
   stakes for a few weeks like the tell you and then move up to increase
   them and then increase the profits.

   Very enjoyable.

   We were looking at the course again only last week, and it has gained

   Since we first looked at it when it launched, the content must have

   well so that it can be followed by anybody.

   I am still learning this but I started a few quick trades over the
   weekend, and made a profit on all but one of them, and the one that
   didn’t make a profit was a break even,. very well demonstrated and
   Stuart is very good with the videos. Answers quickly to even at
   weekends as I asked him a question and he answered at 9pm at night,
   which I didn’t expect. Still going through it all but the fact I have
   already made a profit following what it says is very encouraging. Far
   more bang for your buck than I thought I was getting and definitely
   over delivers. My brother in law started it yesterday also after I told
   him about it, as we did match betting together for a few years and
   wanted the step up, and we both like this trading product a lot.

   Hi admin (Simon, it says in email?),

   I just wanted to put my comment here after getting the email from you
   about it in February. I did spend the required months learning and
   practising as Stuart advises and after using many courses over the last
   10 years or so and wasting huge amounts of capital trying to learn
   trading I really have to say that the value in this course is
   incredible.

   The main problem with most courses is that those presenting them do not
   go into enough detail to make a profit, or to show you what they do to
   make a profit. Stuart is the opposite, he shows you straight away how
   to make a profit and you watch him doing it live.

   Not only that but Stuart breaks it all down into micro segments so that
   you can easily understand it. No other course that I have paid into
   goes even remotely close to the detail given in this course content.

   I’ll give you an example on how I am progressing. This week so far
   including the weekend I have completed 47 trades, 42 of them have been
   profits, 2 losing trades and a few scratch trades. Stuart also teaches
   you about taking them in play to increase profits which is something I
   am doing more and more of. I love that concept.

   So after 8 months on the course, I am making regular profits where I
   have never done this before. This week I have made approximately £236
   after Betfair commissions, so when you bear in mind that I have never
   made a profit before from any course, this is the only content that has
   taught me how to consistently make a profit.

   I was showing my brother in law this Scalper course and how I was using
   it a few weeks ago, and he has now started the course himself and is
   equally impressed. He is not making a profit yet as he has only just
   started with it, but we discuss it on Skype all the time during the day
   as we are both retired and have time. We both did matched betting for a
   few years so we tell our better halves that is what we are doing, but
   the progress cannot be bettered in my opinion.

   Both my wife’s and my own car insurance was due for renewal on the 22nd
   of this month, and I paid for both of both in advance which saves
   interest payments, and paid for them both with profits from this
   trading. It is the first time I have paid for car insurance in bulk,
   and usually do it monthly.

   My wife still works part time at the local school, but my trading is
   going so well now that I have already suggested that she could give
   that up soon as the profits I make easily eclipses the minimum pay she
   gets. She enjoys the job but health wise it is not good for her.

   We also have 6 grand children now, and with Christmas coming up we know
   that we will be in a much better financial position that I can remember
   us being in for many a year.

   Go figure. A brilliant product, and brilliantly executed by a very good
   teacher.

   Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

   I have not started live trading yet but from my practising I can

   I am a few months down the line with this betfair course and it has
   been a revelation in opening my eyes to trading. The course is laid
   out, or was laid out for me as a newcomer in an easy to use fashion and
   the detail it goes into is incredible. I like many others have tried
   various other topic course by the usual names but nothing remotely
   came, or comes close to this course. Here are a few points from me on
   this course:-

   1) Great for a newbie like me.
   2) Very responsive emails if you need them (I did).
   3) Easy enough to learn (I like the structure).
   4) The best explanations I ever watched (easily!)
   5) Stuart (who does the videos) is clearly passionate about wanting it
   to work for you (rare!)
   6) The course explains at length the entry and exit and why you are
   entering trades (rare!)
   7) It works, and I am now at around 92% success win rate after 3 months
   (and a bit).

   My observations from a newcomer to Betfair:-

   1) You will have to learn (obvious!)
   2) It takes time for it all to sink in (it did me anyway!)
   3) The training is very logical (which I needed!)
   4) Make sure you go back through the vids after practising (helps it
   sink in more!)
   5) Do not take trades in play (they teach you this early on!)

   At the price they sell this material at, it is a steal, and I am making
   regularly profits from what I have learned, but I still continue to go
   back through the videos most days, with more videos added all the time.
   Great product, great guys.

   Hi all, just to give my 2 pence worth on this product.

   Stuart is very, very good at explaining how to trade, and knows his
   stuff. The feedback section is also good to see how others are getting
   on with this. I started pretty slowly in September last year as a
   member and it did take me a while to get to grips with it (I am 68
   years old) and I also left it alone for a while, but went back to it
   last month and started again, and I am now doing very nicely.
   I still use smallish stakes but just yesterday I was trading live and
   out of 17 trades I made 16 profits and one break even, and the day
   before that I completed 14 trades with 12 wins, one small loss, and a
   break even so I am pleased with the progress. Very enjoyable too I had
   to add.

   Easily the best online course I have ever had the pleasure of being a
   part of.

   Finally somebody who does actually show you the edges you need to
   trade.

   Some of the earlier stuff I knew about as I have been trading a while,
   good for anyone new to this lark though, but as you go through the
   course the nuggets of trading info on the videos of how it is explained
   is remarkably detailed.

   Best £90 I ever spent and that is coming from somebody who has spent
   years and years on failed promises. Although the videos have turned my
   trading around. One video is particular was eye opening and shown me
   where I had been going wrong when trading a certain market, I tried
   what was suggested and made an 80% increase in profit, to say I was
   surprised would be an understatement. Stuart who made it knows exactly
   what he is doing.

   Hi Geoff,

   There is not enough liquidity in Betdaq as of yet, which is why the
   author recommends Betfair.

   I would say that Betdaq is mainly used by matched bettors, whilst this
   Betfair course is pre race trading, and needs the money that Betfair
   offers.

Profits Using Profits Maximiser Programme

Profit Maximiser is new membership offered by Mike Cruickshank, which shows
new members how they can make as much as £100 per day, using tried and tested
offers that pay CASH incentives.

   Profit Maximiser is a 12 month membership that we have already tested,
   and yes, it makes fantastic profits, just as Mike stated it would. If
   you have an interest in using a programme that will actually show you
   where to pick up easy money, then on our recommendation, we certainly
   advise you to take a look at this.

What is Profit Maximiser Exactly?

   Profit Maximiser is a course, well a programme, where the author, Mike
   Cruickshank will allow you access to a 12 month course of where to find
   hidden cash offers. Now, these hidden cash offers can be as much as
   £100 per day! Not peanuts by any stretch of the imagination. You see
   Mike has been offering a similar service for years, which has attracted
   rave reviews, although now he has put together the complete package,
   even using some of his own secrets which he is now divulging with his
   members.

One member made £80 in their first 5 minutes!

   Nikki Roberts and Her Profits

One member made £11,400 in 5 months!

   That’s right. Members are making money very quickly with Profit
   Maximiser, and you can too.

What do I have to do to make the money?

   Simple, all you have to do is follow the advice of Mike, and he will
   show you exactly where to go to attain the quick profits, and it really
   is that simple. In the Profit Maximiser membership area, there are
   details of where you can start profiting immediately. You simply follow
   the instructions, and collect the money.

Is there a guarantee on Profit Maximiser?

   There is a complete 100% money back guarantee, should Mike not show you
   how easy it is to find these money offers. Therefore you have nothing
   to lose by taking a trial for a month, in which time you will know for
   sure how much money can be made; and remember, this is a 12 month
   membership, where you will be consistently shown where to take free
   money offers.

   How It Works Maximising Profits

How Much Can I Make Using This Membership?

   The only guarantee is that you WILL make a profit from this, and a nice
   one, but the amount of money you make from this will be entirely up to
   the effort you put in. If you have the time to put in, then you can
   keep using the membership all day long, and that way you will keep
   spotting the opportunities to maximise your profits to the full.

   For Example, the following member actually made £1250 in a single day!
   Obviously you would not expect to make that every day, but at least you
   can see that it is possible. The member below posting his success on
   the Profit Maximiser Facebook page, and there were others, too:

   few questions to begin with and Mike the owner was very quick to reply
   and even helped me to profit.

   Does it work? Yes I am in very good profit, and since started have made
   a profit every single week, and remember that this is a 12 month

   £135 made on first day. Say’s it all really. No surprise though, as the

   before.

   You’ll make money with this one, for sure. I already heard about a guy

   about £40-£100 (about) a day since starting this.

   Made money back easily on the first day. Last month on this, I made

   When I first heard about this I was not so sure so did not bother for a
   few months and just continued to read about it. I tried to join their
   facebook group but was declined because I was not a member.

   However I finally joined profit maximiser last week and I wish I had
   done so sooner. So easy is the money to make that I thought something
   was not right at first. I am now a member of the said facebook group
   now I have joined, and the amount of people on there making money is
   ridiculous. Lots of people making extremely good money with this
   product.

   A happy chap also here and I now wish I started it a few months ago
   instead of messing around.

   I say if you have not yet joined this, then you are losing out on some
   very, very easy money to be had.

   income online. In the email the creator (Mike Cruikshank) shows a

   As money is involved Betfair do need to verify accounts sometimes,

   It might be worth asking a family member if they can help you to verify

   Hello,

   You can start with as little capital as you want on Profit Maximiser,
   although the more you have the faster, and larger profits you will
   make. But you can compound your profits, so even if you only had a
   hundred pound or so, compounded, this will grow.

   There are many that have now made over £20,000 with this product, and
   in under 12 months, so that tells you how quickly the profits can grow.

   needn’t be, because Mike who runs it all is VERY helpful to newbies,
   and since starting I have made around £640. Yep, it does make some
   seriously good money, and there is no risk. My wife does some of the
   stuff for me too, and she didn’t believe I was making the money. She
   loves it now, and the money hahaha

   Honestly, even if you have not tried anything like this before, it will
   make you some good money.

   Very happy, and thanks for the email letting me know about this.

   ok so i joined this – I’m actually not sure what i joined when i log
   in.. I don’t understand it. In the time i am trying to work it out –
   its showing me betting sites to go to – I thought i was looking at
   tips. I came to this site and took on recommendation here. In the time
   i was trying to make sense of what I had purchased my trial period ran
   out and they billed me full amount. I of course haven’t worked it out
   so haven’t used it so put a refund in – to get Mike C reply – no refund
   allowed?
   If someone was so successful – why would they begrudge refunding a
   client who wasn’t happy? Seems crooked to me. A successful doesn’t need
   to behave like that penny pinching? I haven’t even used the product –
   whatever it is supposed to be used for. I would be very careful about
   signing up for any trial and diary out prior to address. I feel robbed
   personally.

   BoC raises interest rates when they want people to spend less, which
   slows down the economy. Then it decreases interest rates when they want
   people to spend more, which stimulates the economy.
   Ok, we get that.
   Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of
   my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't
   spend lots of money. Yet I have a decent income which should allow me
   to spend more and contribute more to the economy.
   Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How
   come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy?
   Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of
   buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing
   to the economy, isn't it?

   are poor, they call me a communist.

   Generally if you're not buying products, services, etc that the company
   is selling you are not contributing to their revenue/profits or
   potential expansion. But yes, investments could help a company if they
   can use it to increase their revenue/profits.

   So if the economy is driven by people exchanging services with the help
   of money for transactions (basically, you work to earn money to use
   that money to buy someone else's work), then all of this system of
   stocks (capital) and bonds (debt) are unnecessary tools created for the
   sole purpose of making money from money and manipulating the economy
   using the interest rate of debt.
   Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to
   build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual
   work.
   As opposed to contributing to the economy by working for money as a
   means of transaction to be spent elsewhere. Which is exactly what is
   stimulating the economy.

   Not exactly. Bonds are just debt instruments that companies generally
   use for capital investments which increase productivity or aid in
   producing goods/services. So if that debt is used that way, then it
   does contribute to the economy. It's the same thing for issuing of
   stocks which allows for some capital in exchange for partial ownership
   rather than interest. Then you can say that capital investments the
   companies make are contributing to the economy as they involve
   purchases of goods and services from other companies.
   But, I'd say that trading existing stocks back and forth between
   investors don't really contribute to that cycle, as the money doesn't
   go into the company for any sort of investment. However, one can make
   the argument that those who cash out will end up spending that money
   elsewhere which helps the economy.

   Yes buying stocks, bonds, and even cash deposits all contribute to the
   economy:
   STOCKS - Buying stocks supports the equity markets and allows companies
   to issue new equity. It's a kind of financing. Companies issue equity,
   providing them with cash, and this helps them grow and expand. Equity
   issuance for companies is a very attractive form of financing. While it
   is true that any general stock or ETF transaction you make is probably
   just buying/selling with someone else, the aggregate buying of
   investors over time creates a net buying pressure, and this is what
   allowed any new equity to be issued. For example, [83]Enbridge issued
   $4.6 billion of equity less than a month ago. If nobody was buying the
   TSX, companies could not issue equity (new supply of shares) because
   the prices would just crash downward as supply was added.
   New shares, like those ENB shares, are usually first bought by large
   investment banks. So with this huge $4.6 billion of new shares, you
   have RBC, Morgan Stanley, BMO, CIBC, National Bank, Scotiabank, and TD
   sitting on tons of new shares. This is now in their inventory, and the
   dealers get it out to the market. Indirectly, those new shares of XIC
   might in fact be buying some new ENB shares, via the market makers /
   dealers. Imagine that right after those shares were issued, someone
   came along and bought $10 million in XIC = they buy $338,000 of ENB
   shares. They are likely buying shares from the dealers inventory (RBC,
   BMO, etc). So although it's a complex chain of events, yes
   [84]@MrBlackhill your new share or ETF purchases very much do provide
   financing to companies.
   If you're interested in these processes, I suggest watching some
   Bloomberg Television (and week-end summary shows like Wall Street
   Week). You will see coverage of new equity and bond financing that's
   happening, like big issuances of shares, how those shares were
   received, etc.
   BONDS - When you buy bonds, you are lending money to a variety of
   borrowers. For example an aggregate bond fund will hold a variety of
   debts, including corporate debt and securitized debts. So buying bonds
   will both lend money to corporations (allowing them to function) and
   even buys pools of securitized consumer debts, all kinds of things like
   credit card debts, auto loans, etc.
   BANK DEPOSITS - Even cash / savings deposits help by providing a
   deposit base to the banks. Loans are given out against this deposit
   base. The more in deposits they have, especially locked-in deposits
   like GICs, the more the banks can lend out. Banks obtain their funding
   from many sources, including bonds and deposits.
   I think people forget how much companies (and banks) depend on
   investors and deposits. It's a kind of complacency, when stock and bond
   markets are strong. We've been in very strong markets for the last few
   years, and there has been plentiful availability of equity and bond
   financing. But very "interesting" things happen when investors stop
   buying these assets. Without new bond buyers, companies have a lot of
   trouble issuing debt, and their financing costs rise. Without eager
   equity investors, and NET buying pressure on stocks, companies cannot
   issue equity and must turn to more expensive types of financing, such
   as bonds or bank borrowing.

   That's because of your perspective on the economy.
   I think you have an incorrect perspective on the economy and how it
   works, so I think your frugal lifestyle is just fine and an excellent
   contribution.
   In fact I think a responsible and frugal lifestyle, with significant
   personal savings is GREAT for the economy as it makes you more
   resilient and efficient, and better able to handle the various economic
   gyrations, which again is good.
   Look at all the overspending indebted people, do you think their chaos
   is good for the economy?

   Again we have different perspectives.
   I think investing and helping people do work IS a contribution
   A lawn cutting business does better with a powered mower than a push
   mower, and better with a commercial riding mower than a residential
   push mower.
   In short we have wildly different views on the economy and our economic
   system, which is evident from many discussions.
   And also largely explains our different political views as they pertain
   to economics..

   If it's bad, then why do policymakers and economists (mostly) all

   Because those people are really easy to control, and they like control.
   Oh want to increase spending, drop rates and they get another $50k in
   credit.
   Want to cut spending, hike rates, and their debt will cut their
   cashflows by $500/month.
   Basically gives them a dial to control a large chunk of the economy.
   But it also makes things unstable, painful for those people, and
   occasionally they'll go nuts and just drop rates to zero so they can
   enjoy a "good" economy.
   It's not actually good or healthy for the economy, but it gives those
   in power... POWER. and they like that.

   Thanks for this explanation, it actually fits my understanding, though
   I'm playing Devil's advocate because I'm trying to understand the
   difference between helping the economy by spending vs helping the
   economy by... saving?
   Because I don't get why when we say "we need to stimulate the economy",
   we always mean "we need people to spend more", it never means "we need
   people to save more".
   I'm not sure this will make any sense, but I'll try to add some of my
   thoughts from my limited understanding. On this Monday morning...
   Where I'm trying to understand the difference between these two
   different kinds of contribution to the economy:
    1. The current meaning where we play with interest rates so that
       people take on more debt for the end goal of spending more,
       stimulating the economy
    2. vs The understanding that investing sold be helping the economy
       because it needs lenders (bond buyers) and capital (stock buyers),
       yet we say that when people save more money and spend less, it's...
       bad for the economy

   And that's why I end up concluding that the real source of contribution
   to the economy is #1, transactional, because #2 is only about the
   current tools of our current economic system (capital and debt, a 100%
   human-made system so we could decide to change its rules), tools that
   we don't really need (the tool of capital is only about 400 years old
   so we surely could live without it, though the tool of debt is about
   5,000 years old so for that one it's certainly harder to envision an
   economic system without that tool).
   Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system
   cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so
   if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the
   remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the
   pace of economic growth would slow down, unless we decide to redirect
   that money from a consumption economy to a social economy where extra
   money is spent/invested into education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.
   Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of
   the tools (capital &amp; debt), because we need an equilibrium between the
   lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money
   saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system
   because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough
   borrowers (those who spend).
   Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always
   good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money
   is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount
   of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly
   come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

   Thanks for this explanation, it actually fits my understanding, though
   I'm playing Devil's advocate because I'm trying to understand the
   difference between helping the economy by spending vs helping the
   economy by... saving?
   Because I don't get why when we say "we need to stimulate the economy",
   we always mean "we need people to spend more", it never means "we need
   people to save more".

   Nope, capital is an abstract term meaning "resources", and it's a real
   physical thing. You're just looking at the abstractions instead of the
   real items.
   You could do away with the abstractions of currency and "capital" and
   debt, but it's the same thing.
   Currency is really a "debt" of a type I'm working in advance, and paid
   a currency, which represents a debt that the person giving it now owes
   me. which I can trade for items, or future work.
   Debt has existed in some form for a long time, "I'll scratch your back,
   and you scratch mine" is a form of "debt" or social contract.

   Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system
   cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so
   if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the
   remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the

   But you'd be spending on the essential needs, I think we could spend
   almost all our money on "education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.". Interestingly you forgot about defense.
   I don't believe in "no spending", it just doesn't make sense.
   I also think getting lost in the abstractions can be problematic.
   They are incredibly useful abstractions, and we've build massive
   systems on them, but occasionally it's important to consider them from
   first principles.

   When the government gives a lot of people money there is always a
   noticeable bump to the GDP and economy.
   If people invest or save the money there is no bump to the economy and
   it is referred to by central bankers as "dead money".
   If everyone was frugal to the extreme there would be fewer companies
   and employees and the economy would shrink and enter a recession.
   Our economy is a "consumer spending" economy depending on a balance of
   incomes and prices, which is why rising income and wealth disparity is
   dangerous to the economy.
   Businesses depend on mass consumer spending and expand production and
   services (jobs) when consumer demand warrants it.
   I have yet to hear a company say they are expanding production because
   rich people have more money invested in stock markets.

   When the government gives people money, it causes an temporary bump,
   which gets paid back later when they pay off the debt.
   or they make it systemic, and it pushes up inflation.
   The thing is that money should represent work, or value, and if they
   just put out more, it's call inflation, but really what they mean is
   they're discounting the value of the work you did.
   Your 1.5hrs of min wage work for $10hr a decade ago is only worth 1
   hour of $15/hr min wage work today.
   The "stimulus" is just shuffling around deck chairs.
   Real economic growth is creation of value, and doing things.
   It could be dumb things or good things, but that's a different issue.
   I don't think people have trouble with consumers buying stuff, it's
   just the silly wastefulness.
   I don't see anything wrong with saving, or hiring a personal trainer,
   or paying for an extra dental cleaning.
   I do think it's wasteful to fill a swimming pool with orbeez, and I'm
   glad that trend died out. So I don't do that.

   Ok, we get that.
   Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of
   my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't
   spend lots of money. Yet I have a decent income which should allow me
   to spend more and contribute more to the economy.
   Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How
   come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy?
   Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of
   buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing
   to the economy, isn't it?

   It's been a long time since I took economics, but essentially it's the
   mulitiplier effect (I cannot remember the exact term). Types of
   spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a
   multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a
   number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers,
   etc) within that system. Government spending also has another
   multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and
   Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the
   economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for
   someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the
   buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving
   is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item
   with but the multiplier is now lower.
   Sorry if that isn't very clear, Its' been almost 30 years since I took
   this, I wonder if the theory has changed. Probably.

   Because the negative effect on the debt at a macro level still produces
   a larger increase in the economy at a macro economics level. The
   problem is the microeconomics of it, debt on an individual level is bad
   in general which is the reverse. If we are looking at the balance, the
   policymakers should be incentivizing those that can spend more with out
   debt to do so.

   Yes it is. It's just not done directly by you and it is outside your
   control.
   GDP measures everything a country produces.
   GDP=C+I+(X-M)+G
   where C=consumption and I=investment
   [the other terms are exports, imports and government spending]
   Your consumption to meet your current needs is clearly part of C and if
   you reduce your actual spend year over year you would contribute to a
   decline in demand transmitted through C.
   "I" on the other hand is expenditures that are capital goods. Eg
   business buying new machines, new buildings etc. When you put it in the
   Bank you are leaving it up to the Bank to lend it to the eventual user
   that will make the capital investment.
   Added: to be clear. "I" does not include financial assets. It is
   physical investments by business. When you purchase financial assets
   you are facilitating the ability of business to grow the economy.

   GDP is defined by the following formula: GDP = Consumption + Investment
   + Government Spending + Net Exports
   Even if you spend $0 and just buy investments, you are still
   contributing to GDP. Your purchase of investments boosts the assett
   price and encourage other people to spend more because of wealth
   effect.
   Don't feel bad about being frugal. Stable spending habit is more
   valuable than boom and bust. Of course, the risk is asset bubble.
   I have no problem with central banks manipulating consumer habits. The
   problem I have with central bank is they manipulate the financial
   market by fooling people to buy high with 0% interest rate and now
   trying to fool people into selling low by hiking interest rate to the
   highest in 7 years. The fact that they waited in 2021 for a freaking 1
   year before hiking interest rate at the point inflation reached a
   whopping 8% and now they are not happy with 3% inflation? and keep
   hiking?
   Mortgage payment increase far exeeds the inflation damage to my cash
   flow. My total expense remained the same or even dropped because I cut
   it substantially vs 2021 but mortgage payment will increase few
   hundreds $ / month soon if they don't cut it. They are playing a very
   dangerous game: global population is peaking and birth rate is dropping
   across the globe. With fewer population, they can't have high interest
   rate for long, look at Japan. I no longer act on investing decision
   based on Fed actions. No longer be a sheep to the Fed. I buy and hold
   best investment forever like the best investors do. Not jumping in and
   out of different investment vehicles because of different interest
   rate. Don't fall into the trap of buy high and sell low! Long term bond
   crashed ? Don't sell low! They will come back up.

   Yet ultimately, "stimulating" the economy is about spending more, not

   Yeah GDP is a funny metric... It measures everything, except what
   matters.
   Simon Kuznets, who won a Nobel prize for developing the GDP metric,
   repeatedly warned that the GDP only measured market activity and should
   not be mistaken for a metric of social or even economic well-being.
   If I mow my lawn and you mow your lawn, GDP says nothing. If I mow your
   lawn for $100 and you mow my lawn for $100, GDP goes up.
   If I have time to take care of my parents and my kids, GDP says
   nothing. If my kids are at the daycare and my parents are in a senior
   home, GDP goes up.
   If I cut down a forest and sell the timber, GDP goes up. If I strip a
   mountain range to mine coal, GDP goes up. If we extend the working day
   and push back retirement age, GDP goes up.
   But, aside from the GDP debate, even though my investments (I) are part
   of the GDP, what we prefer is my consumption (C). I've always heard the
   need to stimulate the economy as a need to increase spending by
   consumers, therefore consumption (C), and I've never heard about the
   need to increase savings by individuals, therefore investments (I) as a
   means to stimulate the economy. It shows when we see BoC decreasing
   rates to increase spending to simulate the economy vs BoC increasing
   rates to decrease spending to slow down the economy.
   Actually, what are we implying when we say "stimulate the economy" or
   "slow down the economy"? It's about the economic activity? What is the
   measure of economic activity? GDP? Actually, we're "fighting"
   inflation, isn't, that's what we mean? So "economic activity" is
   translated as "inflation"?
   Maybe it has to do with that multiplier that [211]@Plugging Along is
   talking about. That's why the focus is always on spending, because it
   has the greatest impact.

   Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting
   money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate
   bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to
   put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank
   where it doesn't circulate in the economy. Rather than looking at the
   safety of the banks or GICs, people would be encouraged to find other
   sources of return. Unfortunately, in Canada, we've been encouraged with
   the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now
   we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception
   exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of
   looking into investing in companies.

   Yes I think so too. And all that money into real estate is very
   unproductive. It's a terrible misallocation of capital IMO.
   I suspect that we will be paying the consequences for several decades.

   [32]Leaving Canada Pension Plan could save Albertans billions, says
   study | Reuters
   Although I know this is mostly a political ploy reminiscent of what
   would happen to Canada/the provinces if Quebec pursued sovereignty.
   However the news of the report on how much Alberta should/would receive
   piqued my interest. Perhaps because I had a lot of involvement with
   Lifeworks (formerly Morneau Scheppel) as a H&amp;W benefit trustee. I
   haven't been able to locate the report but it does get me thinking.
   How would this all work?
   Who would be entitled to the new plan?
   How would the payout restructuring work? etc
   I know a lot of this would have to be sorted out by lawyers and
   actuaries. However, if Brexit is possible perhaps deconstructing a
   national pension system is also doable. Has Western alienation taken a
   deep enough hold to make this a possibility. I don't believe so but I
   don't really know how any of it would work. If someone is able to get
   the report I would love to give it a read.
   My apologies if there is already a discussion started in the non money
   topic threads.

   From what was reported, the report is full off errors, miscalculations,
   and self serving assumptions.
   They claim 53% of the CPP fund based on their conclusions.
   The CPP pegs the actual number contributed by Albertans at 16% of the
   fund including the investment gains.
   If Ontario did the same calculation and left the fund before Alberta
   there wouldn't be enough left in the fund to pay Alberta in full or
   anyone else.
   If both Alberta and Ontario left there wouldn't be anything left to pay
   the other Provinces.
   Obviously that isn't going to happen.
   I don't think it is going anywhere because the vast majority of
   Albertans are opposed to it.

   ... your last sentence - all dang, I was hoping that majority would say
   'YES' and support their quack premier. In fact, I would wholeheartedly
   SUPPORT their quack premier's on this - Alberta's pull-out (not
   dismantling) from the national's CPP.
   They can even opt-out immediately and get the EFF out from the rest of
   Canada just as Quebec had wished to. And while they're at that - take
   their EFF quack premier with them. Like the rest of Canada are gonna to
   miss them quacks, including those EFFING FreeDumbers, wasting everyone
   else's money and time.
   And no, their contributions weren't more than half, far less than that
   as they're only 1 province of 10 for Canada with a population that's
   far far less than the eastern ones. Simple math.

   Didn't Alberta's own fund (AIMCo) punch a massive hole in their fund by
   stupidly gambling on volatility derivatives? They lost $4 billion on
   that ridiculous investment.
   Hope they make better choices with their investments if they step away
   from CPP

[82]Alberta loses billions in faulty strategy

   This Bloomberg article tipped me off. Has anyone else heard about this?
   Apparently, AIMCo (the Alberta Investment Management Corp., which
   invests Alberta public pensions) lost billions of $ on faulty
   volatility strategies during the recent market crash...

   Here's the link to the actual report. [92]Alberta pension plan :
   analysis of costs, benefits, risks and considerations - Open Government
   Looks like it was a waste of money, given that its methodology was
   flawed. On the surface it seems to make sense, the asset calculation
   would be contribution with investment returns minus what has been paid
   out. The problem is how they calculate what was paid out. They base it
   only on the people collecting CPP in Alberta, which completely
   overlooks the fact that people would work in Alberta to contribute, but
   then retire outside the province and collect CPP. The problem is that
   they don't include those out-of-province retirees. In fact, they
   actually state that as one of the deficiencies in the study on page 14:
   (iii) Similarly, we believe that the benefit payments attributed to
   Alberta in the publicly available information are based on CPP payments
   made to Alberta residents. Additional refinements may be needed for an
   actual final calculation to reflect the payments to individuals who
   migrated to or from Alberta following retirement or who had a period of
   employment in Alberta.
   And it's pretty obvious that's how they calculated it when you look at
   Annex B: Table B.1.a – Historical Base CPP and Alberta contributions,
   benefits, operating expenses and rates of return ($million except where
   noted).
   All this does is reinforce the fact that people advocating for the APP
   still forget the fact that the CPP belongs to the individual and not
   the province where contributions occurred.

   Thank you for the report and highlighting its key flaws. I am 99%
   certain this initiative won't happen but wanted to explore the concept
   further more from a hypothetical perspective. Not for a moment did I
   believe some of the numbers being put out in our mainstream media. Even
   this link [114]Your pension, your choice | alberta.ca which has some
   interesting information makes some crazy assumptions.
   "Alberta’s government would work with partners at the CPP to develop
   agreements that would allow individuals to move throughout Canada
   without disrupting or decreasing benefits."
   Can Canadians move throughout the country without changing their
   benefits now? Of course they can. 🤦‍♂️
   What I did find interesting in the report was the provisions in place
   for a province to opt out of the plan. And as I imagined implementation
   would be both costly and cumbersome.
   I struggled with the claims that Albertans pay considerably more than
   their share into the plan than they receive and found this report from
   the Fraser institute from 2019.
   [115]Albertans Make Disproportionate Contributions to National
   Programs: The Canada Pension Plan as a Case Study (fraserinstitute.org)
   TLDR - AB has a higher employment rate. Alberta has a higher income
   rate. Therefore AB contributes more per capita than other provinces.
   Another item of interest to me in the Fraser report is the
   interprovincial migration data for those 65 had a slight overlap to the
   years the CPP made a small net payment to retirees. Not sure there is
   any significance in the observation but these peculiarities always
   catch my attention.

   I do think the changes made to the CPP have addressed some of the
   concerns put forward in the Fraser report regarding potential
   shortfalls.

   The Premier is between a rock and a hard place. She does not control
   her UCP Party. It and she are controlled by a group by the name of Take
   Back Alberta. They are pulling the strings. Anti science, populist, far
   right, politics and religion combo group. As a result her Party has
   seem many of the old hands, the pros leave the party. Similar in many
   instance to what has happened to the CPC over the past number of years.
   My spouses crazy hillbilly cousins think she is bees knees. That alone
   speaks volumes to me!
   Don't forget.... our Premier is a person who for weeks touted
   hydroxychloroquine as a cure for covid on her open line radio show.
   That is after everyone else walked away from it given the scientific
   evidence to the contrary. She got bounced off the radio station. They
   apparently could not deal with her nonsense any longer.
   If that is not enough, she has so little insight into our justice
   system that for weeks she was suggesting publicly, multiple times, that
   as Premier she would have the ability to 'pardon' people who were
   convicted of covid related and border blocking offences in court and
   found guilty. And she would do so.
   She is an embarrassment to Albertans. The depth of her ignorance in how
   Government works and our justice system in Canada has no limits.

   CPP benefits are determined by level of and duration of contributions.
   If Alberta workers are earn more and work longer they will receive
   higher benefits than those who don't.......regardless of where they
   live and work.
   The benefit is based on the individual contributions, which people can
   view at the Service Canada website.
   As already noted.......the CPP belongs solely and entirely to
   individual workers and no government has any right to claim any part of
   it.
   The CPP also has disability pensions, survivor pensions, and a small
   $2500 death benefit mixed into the calculations.
   The only way to windup the CPP fund equitably would be to freeze all
   contributions from Albertans and pay out the benefits when they are due
   to be paid.
   Alberta could start their own pension fund but would have to do it with
   their own money like the Saskatchewan Pension Plan has already done.

   AIMCO did lose a bunch of cash and they were using pooled pension money
   from the pensions they govern. It is my understanding that LAPP was
   skeptical of the AIMCO investment as it relates to the loss in the
   above discussion and insured the investment and cut the LAPP portion of
   the loss by +/- 20%. I'd have to read to get the true numbers but LAPP
   saved their own *** on that one.

   Exactly right. Using me as an example, I worked and lived in Alberta
   for 20 years but retired elsewhere in Canada. If there was an APP at
   the time with a sharing agreement similar to QPP, then APP would still
   have had an obligation to fund a share of what CPP pays me so that has
   to be accounted for in the formula (like it is for payments to retirees
   outside of Canada). The fact that the discrepancy is so huge is
   interesting. The political line is that Alberta has massively
   over-contributed but it seems that the reality is simply that many
   Canadians have chosen to work in Alberta and then retire elsewhere.

   The Premier is between a rock and a hard place. She does not control
   her UCP Party. It and she are controlled by a group by the name of Take
   Back Alberta. They are pulling the strings. Anti science, populist, far
   right, politics and religion combo group. As a result her Party has
   seem many of the old hands, the pros leave the party. Similar in many
   instance to what has happened to the CPC over the past number of years.
   My spouses crazy hillbilly cousins think she is bees knees. That alone
   speaks volumes to me!
   Don't forget.... our Premier is a person who for weeks touted
   hydroxychloroquine as a cure for covid on her open line radio show.
   That is after everyone else walked away from it given the scientific
   evidence to the contrary. She got bounced off the radio station. They
   apparently could not deal with her nonsense any longer.
   If that is not enough, she has so little insight into our justice
   system that for weeks she was suggesting publicly, multiple times, that
   as Premier she would have the ability to 'pardon' people who were
   convicted of covid related and border blocking offences in court and
   found guilty. And she would do so.
   She is an embarrassment to Albertans. The depth of her ignorance in how
   Government works and our justice system in Canada has no limits.

   ... sounds like she immigrated from the camp of MToiletG, LB the little
   b1tch, KL, etc ... she should be working for "boss" Trump instead.
   If she wants to stay and work in Canada, I can make a recommendation
   for her with one of my ex-bosses too. But she'll have to move to
   Pickering, Ontario though.

   It is amazing just how ignorant some people are. When Tamara Lich's
   husband went before an Ottawa magistrate during the freedom march he
   tried to claim as a defence that he was only 'protecting' his First
   Amendment rights. He really did not have a clue. The magistrate was
   less than impressed.

   Most of the freedumb people watch FOX News. It is unsurprising when
   they develop the misapprehension that they live in the US, instead of
   an entirely different country.

   Exactly right. Using me as an example, I worked and lived in Alberta
   for 20 years but retired elsewhere in Canada. If there was an APP at
   the time with a sharing agreement similar to QPP, then APP would still
   have had an obligation to fund a share of what CPP pays me so that has
   to be accounted for in the formula (like it is for payments to retirees
   outside of Canada). The fact that the discrepancy is so huge is
   interesting. The political line is that Alberta has massively
   over-contributed but it seems that the reality is simply that many
   Canadians have chosen to work in Alberta and then retire elsewhere.

   How it would work in practice is that the provincial pension plan would
   pay your benefits wherever you live, just as if you moved to another
   country.

   We have friends who worked in Fort McMurray for 20 years flying back
   and forth to Ontario and then returned permanently when he found a good
   job in Ontario.
   Our son worked in Alberta for a year and paid into CPP, so some of his
   benefit would have to be paid by Alberta.
   They base the calculations on a young work force, but if they divided
   up the CPP fund the same as a commuted value of a pension, wouldn't
   young people get smaller amounts due to the length of time for the
   invested capital to grow until retirement ?

   Shiver me timbers lads.....be it smooth sailing or stormy seas ahead.

   Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as
   payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes,
   in a particular country or socio-economic context.^[1]^[2]^[3] The
   primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a
   unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred
   payment.

   Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed
   intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems
   are based on unbacked fiat money without use value.^[4] Its value is
   consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a
   government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be
   accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for
   "all debts, public and private", in the case of the United States
   dollar.

   The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation
   (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular
   definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in
   checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts).
   Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions
   and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment,
   forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.

Etymology

   The word money derives from the Latin word moneta with the meaning
   "coin" via French monnaie. The Latin word is believed to originate from
   a temple of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the
   ancient world, Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno
   Moneta at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was
   located.^[5] The name "Juno" may have derived from the Etruscan goddess
   Uni and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or
   instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

   In the Western world a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie,
   stemming from Latin in specie, meaning "in kind".^[6]

   Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of
   commodity money. The Mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight, and
   relied on the mass of something like 160 grains of barley.^[12] The
   first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. Societies
   in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used shell money—often, the
   shells of the cowry (Cypraea moneta L. or C. annulus L.). According to
   Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to introduce the use of
   gold and silver coins.^[13] It is thought by modern scholars that these
   first stamped coins were minted around 650 to 600 BC.^[14]
   [170px-Jiao_zi.jpg] Song Dynasty Jiaozi, the world's earliest paper

   The system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of
   representative money.^[citation needed] This occurred because gold and
   silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors,
   redeemable for the commodity money deposited. Eventually, these
   receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used
   as money. Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the
   Song dynasty. These banknotes, known as "jiaozi", evolved from
   promissory notes that had been used since the 7th century. However,
   they did not displace commodity money and were used alongside coins. In
   the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the
   accounts of travellers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck.^[15]
   Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty is the
   subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled
   "How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like
   Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country."^[16] Banknotes were
   first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco in 1661 and were again also
   used alongside coins. The gold standard, a monetary system where the
   medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set,
--
   the convertibility of the dollar to gold. After this many countries
   de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the
   world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments'
   fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods
   via payment. According to proponents of modern money theory, fiat money
   is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for
   the currency they issue.^[17]

   In Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons
   famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a medium of
   exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of
   value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919,
   Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet:

          Money's a matter of functions four,
          A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.^[18]

   This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics
--
   but rather subsuming it in the others.^[4]^[20]^[21]

   There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of
   money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that
   a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these
   arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange conflicts
   with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value
   requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of
   exchange requires it to circulate.^[22] Others argue that storing of
   value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact
   that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across
   space and time. The term "financial capital" is a more general and
   inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a
   uniformly recognized tender.

   Main article: Medium of exchange

   When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services,
   it is performing a function as a medium of exchange. It thereby avoids
   the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the inability to
   permanently ensure "coincidence of wants". For example, between two
--
   and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for
   the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.

   Money acts as a standard measure and a common denomination of trade. It
   is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary
   for developing efficient accounting systems like double-entry
   bookkeeping.
--
   particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other
   functions.^[4]^[20]^[21]^[clarification needed] A "standard of deferred
   payment" is an accepted way to settle a debt—a unit in which debts are
   denominated, and the status of money as legal tender, in those
   jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for
   the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real
   value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation, and for
   sovereign and international debts via debasement and devaluation.

--

   Main article: Store of value

   To act as a store of value, money must be able to be reliably saved,
   stored, and retrieved—and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange
   when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable
   over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of
   money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of
   value.^[4]^[failed verification]

Properties

   The functions of money are that it is a medium of exchange, a unit of
   account, and a store of value.^[24] To fulfill these various functions,
   money must be:^[25]
     * Fungible: its individual units must be capable of mutual
       substitution (i.e., interchangeability).
     * Durable: able to withstand repeated use.
     * Divisible: divisible to small units.
     * Portable: easily carried and transported.
     * Acceptable: most people must accept the money as payment
     * Scarce: its supply in circulation must be limited.^[25]

Money supply

   Main article: Money supply

   In economics, money is any financial instrument that can fulfill the
   functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments
   together are collectively referred to as the money supply of an
   economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial
   instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or
   services. Since the money supply consists of various financial
   instruments (usually currency, demand deposits, and various other types
   of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding
   together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.

   Economists employ different ways to measure the stock of money or money
   supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a
   categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial
   instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates
   (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2, and M3. These
   are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and
   bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus
   savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; M3 is M2 plus larger
--
   instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2, etc. may be different in
   different countries.

   Another measure of money, M0, is also used. M0 is base money, or the
   amount of money actually issued by the central bank of a country. It is
   measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at
   the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the
   reserve requirements of commercial banks.

  Creation of money

   In current economic systems, money is created by two
   procedures:^[citation needed]

   Legal tender, or narrow money (M0) is the cash created by a Central
   Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.

   Bank money, or broad money (M1/M2) is the money created by private
   banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients,
   with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money
   is created as electronic money.

   Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions
   and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment,
   forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed
   countries.^[26]^[27]^[28]

   In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by
   commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions,
   banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that
   savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to
   create new loans and deposits.^[29]

  Market liquidity
--
   Main article: Market liquidity

   "Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for
   another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is
   the most liquid asset because it is universally recognized and accepted
   as a common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to
   trade goods and services easily without having to barter.

   Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low
   transaction costs. There should be no (or minimal) spread between the
   prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.

Types

  Commodity

   Main article: Commodity money

   [170px-1914_Sydney_Half_Sovereign_-_St._George.jpg] A 1914 British gold
   sovereign

   Many items have been used as commodity money such as naturally scarce
   precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads, etc., as well as many
   other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value
   comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself
   constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.^[30] Examples of
   commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold,
   silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones,
   decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc.
   These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in
   conjunction with one another, in various commodity valuation or price
   system economies. The use of commodity money is similar to barter, but
   a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for
   the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins
   such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record
   of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this
   is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value
--

  Representative

   Main article: Representative money

   In 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the
   money used at the time as "representative money". Representative money
   is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other physical
   tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed
   quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of
   representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the
   commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that
   commodity.^[33]

  Fiat

   Main article: Fiat money

   [170px-2006_AEGold_Proof_Rev.png] Gold coins are an example of legal
   tender that are traded for their intrinsic value, rather than their
   face value.

   Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from
   any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a
   valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by
   government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat
--
   face value (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion
   value).^[32]^[36]

   Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or
   coins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money
   has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the
   same laws that created the money can also define rules for its
   replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S.
   government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat
   money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or
   if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.^[37] By contrast,
   commodity money that has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.

  Coinage

--

   In premodern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium
   that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led
   to the introduction of paper money. This economic phenomenon was a slow
   and gradual process that took place from the late Tang dynasty
   (618–907) into the Song dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for
   merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as
--
   century the government finally took over these shops to produce
   state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally
   valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a
   standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an
   acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of
   woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the
   11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money
   in premodern China.

   At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous
   monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis

   institutions for loans and deposits.^[39]^[need quotation to verify]

   In Europe, paper money was first introduced in Sweden in 1661. Sweden
   was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value,
   extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be
   made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced
--
   However, these advantages are held within their disadvantages. First,
   since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing
   authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it
   with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased
   inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th
   century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an
   inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding
   hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The
   printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of
   wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army.
   For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility
   in Europe and America. It was also addictive since the speculative
   profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations
   established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their
   treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.

   At this time both silver and gold were considered legal tender, and
--
   [220px-Sweet_success.jpg] A check, used as a means of converting funds
   in a demand deposit to cash

   Commercial bank money or demand deposits are claims against financial
   institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A
   demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn
   at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or
--
   checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or
   through online banking.^[40]

   Commercial bank money is created by commercial banks whose reserves
   (held as cash and other highly liquid assets) typically constitute only
   a fraction of their deposits, while the banks maintain an obligation to
   redeem all these deposits upon demand - a practise known as
   fractional-reserve banking.^[41] Commercial bank money differs from
   commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as
   its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and
   other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of
   risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution
   becomes insolvent.

   The money multiplier theory presents the process of creating commercial
   bank money as a multiple (greater than 1) of the amount of base money
   created by the country's central bank, the multiple itself being a
   function of the legal regulation of banks imposed by financial
   regulators (e.g., potential reserve requirements) beside the business
   policies of commercial banks and the preferences of households -
   factors which the central bank can influence, but not control
   completely.^[42] Contemporary central banks generally do not control
   the creation of money, nor do they try to, though their interest
   rate-setting monetary policies naturally affect the amount of loans and
   deposits that commercial banks create.^[43]^[44]^[45]

  Digital or electronic

   Main article: Digital money

   The development of computer technology in the second part of the
   twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990,
   in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and
   commercial banks was in electronic form. By the 2000s most money
   existed as digital currency in bank databases.^[46] In 2012, by number
   of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic
   (dependent on country).^[47]

   Anonymous digital currencies were developed in the early 2000s. Early
   examples include Ecash, bit gold, RPOW, and b-money. Not much
   innovation occurred until the conception of Bitcoin in 2008, which
   introduced the concept of a decentralised currency that requires no
   trusted third party.^[48]

   When gold and silver were used as money, the money supply could grow
   only if the supply of these metals was increased by mining. This rate
   of increase would accelerate during periods of gold rushes and
   discoveries, such as when Columbus traveled to the New World and
--
   down. However, if the rate of gold mining could not keep up with the
   growth of the economy, gold became relatively more valuable, and prices
   (denominated in gold) would drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the
   more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money
   backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.

   Modern-day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer
   tied to the value of gold. The amount of money in the economy is
   influenced by monetary policy, which is the process by which a central
   bank influences the economy to achieve specific goals. Often, the goal
   of monetary policy is to maintain low and stable inflation, directly
--

   Monetary policy strategies have changed over time.^[52] Some of the
   tools used to conduct contemporary monetary policy include:^[53]
     * changing the interest rate at which the central bank loans money to
       (or borrows money from) the commercial banks
     * open market operations including currency purchases or sales
     * forward guidance, i.e. publishing forecasts to communicate the
       likely future course of monetary policy
--

   During the 1970s and 1980s monetary policy in several countries was
   influenced by an economic theory known as monetarism. Monetarism argued
   that management of the money supply should be the primary means of
   regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money
   prior to the 1980s was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna
   Schwartz^[54] supported by the work of David Laidler,^[55] and many
   others. It turned out, however, that maintaining a monetary policy
   strategy of targeting the money supply did not work very well: The
   relation between money growth and inflation was not as tight as
   expected by monetarist theory, and the short-run relation between the
   money supply and the interest rate, which is the chief instrument
   through which the cental bank can influence output and inflation, was
   unreliable. Both problems were due to unpredictable shifts in the
   demand for money. Consequently, starting in the early 1990s a
   fundamental reorientation took place in most major central banks,
   starting to target inflation directly instead of the money supply and
   using the interest rate as their main instrument.^[56]

   The definition of money says it is money only "in a particular country
   or socio-economic context". In general, communities only use a single
   measure of value, which can be identified in the prices of goods listed
   for sale. There might be multiple media of exchange, which can be
   observed by what is given to purchase goods ("medium of exchange"),
   etc. In most countries, the government acts to encourage a particular

   Some places do maintain two or more currencies, particularly in border
   towns or high-travel areas. Shops in these locations might list prices

   traders.

   Communities can change the money they use, which is known as currency
   substitution. This can happen intentionally, when a government issues a
   new currency. For example, when Brazil moved from the Brazilian
   cruzeiro to the Brazilian real. It can also happen spontaneously, when
   the people refuse to accept a currency experiencing hyperinflation
   (even if its use is encouraged by the government).

   The money used by a community can change on a smaller scale. This can
   come through innovation, such as the adoption of cheques (checks).
   Gresham's law says that "bad money drives out good". That is, when
   buying a good, a person is more likely to pass on less-desirable items
   that qualify as "money" and hold on to more valuable ones. For example,
   coins with less silver in them (but which are still valid coins) are
   more likely to circulate in the community. This may effectively change
   the money used by a community.

   The money used by a community does not have to be a currency issued by
   a government. A famous example of community adopting a new form of
   money is prisoners-of-war using cigarettes to trade.^[57]

  Counterfeiting

   Main article: Counterfeit money

   Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal
   sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit
   money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as
   money itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of
   Lydian coins which are thought to be among the first western
   coins.^[58] Historically, objects that were difficult to counterfeit
   (e.g. shells, rare stones, precious metals) were often chosen as
   money.^[59] Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent
   method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or
   silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by
   legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During

   Ok, we get that.
   Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of
   my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't
   spend lots of money. Yet I have a decent income which should allow me
   to spend more and contribute more to the economy.
   Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments... How
   come saving money isn't considered as a contribution to the economy?
   Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of
   buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing
   to the economy, isn't it?

   So if the economy is driven by people exchanging services with the help
   of money for transactions (basically, you work to earn money to use
   that money to buy someone else's work), then all of this system of
   stocks (capital) and bonds (debt) are unnecessary tools created for the
   sole purpose of making money from money and manipulating the economy
   using the interest rate of debt.
   Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to
   build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual
   work.
   As opposed to contributing to the economy by working for money as a
   means of transaction to be spent elsewhere. Which is exactly what is
   stimulating the economy.

   companies make are contributing to the economy as they involve
   purchases of goods and services from other companies.
   But, I'd say that trading existing stocks back and forth between
   investors don't really contribute to that cycle, as the money doesn't
   go into the company for any sort of investment. However, one can make
   the argument that those who cash out will end up spending that money
   elsewhere which helps the economy.

--
   Where I'm trying to get (in my confusion) is that an economic system
   cannot exist without #1, because no spending means no transactions, so
   if everybody were to spend only on essential needs and invest the
   remaining money, the current consumption economy would collapse and the
   pace of economic growth would slow down, unless we decide to redirect
   that money from a consumption economy to a social economy where extra
   money is spent/invested into education, healthcare, shelter, all the
   essential needs.
   Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of
   the tools (capital &amp; debt), because we need an equilibrium between the
   lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money
   saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system
   because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough
   borrowers (those who spend).
   Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always
   good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money
   is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount
   of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly
   come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

   When the government gives a lot of people money there is always a
   noticeable bump to the GDP and economy.
   If people invest or save the money there is no bump to the economy and
   it is referred to by central bankers as "dead money".
   If everyone was frugal to the extreme there would be fewer companies
   and employees and the economy would shrink and enter a recession.

   When the government gives people money, it causes an temporary bump,
   which gets paid back later when they pay off the debt.
   or they make it systemic, and it pushes up inflation.
   The thing is that money should represent work, or value, and if they
   just put out more, it's call inflation, but really what they mean is
   they're discounting the value of the work you did.

   It's been a long time since I took economics, but essentially it's the
   mulitiplier effect (I cannot remember the exact term). Types of
   spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a
   multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a
   number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers,
   etc) within that system. Government spending also has another
   multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and
   Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the
   economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for
   someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the
   buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving
   is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item
   with but the multiplier is now lower.

   Yet ultimately, "stimulating" the economy is about spending more, not
   saving more. Because spending has a much greater effect than saving.
   Imagine the situation where most people were saving money and barely
   spending vs if most people were spending money and barely saving.

   Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting
   money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate
   bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to
   put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank
   where it doesn't circulate in the economy. Rather than looking at the
   safety of the banks or GICs, people would be encouraged to find other
   sources of return. Unfortunately, in Canada, we've been encouraged with
   the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now
   we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception
   exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of
   looking into investing in companies.

   Yes I think so too. And all that money into real estate is very
   unproductive. It's a terrible misallocation of capital IMO.

   Smith will hold a referendum.
   She is counting on support from the far right hillbillies in rural
   Alberta.
   A common refrain is 'I do not trust Trudeau with my pension money'
   That is the level of ignorance that Smith is counting on to win the
   referendum. They have no idea and are not interested in knowing. If it
   is on facebook it must be true.

   That has always been the way I interpreted the situation. I always got
   the impression people made their money in Alberta, and then returned
   back to where they came from. And then there are those who would retire

How to find unclaimed money from the government

   Find unclaimed funds held by the government that might be owed to you.

What is unclaimed money?

   If a business, financial institution, or government owes you money that
   you did not collect, it is considered unclaimed money or property.

   You may be able to file for unclaimed money owed to you or that was
   owed to a deceased relative if you are their legal heir.

Search by state

   Most unclaimed money is held by state governments from sources such as
   bank accounts, insurance policies, or state agencies.

   Search for unclaimed money from your state’s unclaimed property office.
   If you have lived in other states, check their unclaimed property
   offices, too.

Search other databases

   There is no single government database for all unclaimed money. Use
   each separate database in the links below to search for each type of
   unclaimed money.

How to talk to your children about money

   Children who are better with money tend to have learnt these skills
   from their parents or carers. Giving your child the opportunity to
   spend and save from an early age allows them to develop the skills they
   need to make good choices about money now and in the future.
   Man and young girl playing with coloured blocks

What’s in this guide

     * Talking to children about money can be difficult
     * It’s easier than you think
     * Start when your child is still young
     * You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money
     * A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   As a parent or carer, you are the most important influence on your
   child’s attitude to money. And you can help them to learn the essential
   skills they’ll use to manage money throughout their lives.

   We’ll show you how to help 3 to 11 year olds understand:
     * where money comes from and what you use it for
     * how to make good choices and learn from their mistakes
     * the benefits of saving
     * how to make choices about what to buy with the money they have
     * the difference between wants and needs.

   Supporting your child to build a healthy relationship with money
   doesn’t happen overnight. Talking openly and practising in real life
   will help your child to pick up the skills they need.

Talking to children about money can be difficult

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

It’s never too early to talk money

   Mr Orangutan asking himself a question

   We want our children to grow up feeling confident about managing money.
   However, it’s often difficult to talk about money – it can be an
   emotional topic, especially if you have had your own issues with it or
   feel you would say the wrong thing.


   You may feel that money discussions are better left until your child is
   older. But this can stop them from developing the skills they need to
   look after their money in the long term.
   Back to top

It’s easier than you think

   The good news is you don’t have to manage your own money perfectly to
   be able to teach your children good habits. You just need to decide
   what you want to teach them and keep it simple.

--

Start when your child is still young

   Our habits around money can start to form from around the age of seven.
   This includes whether you spend money straight away or like to save up.
   Children learn not just from what you tell them but from what they see
   you doing, so starting early helps to build good habits.

   There’s no reason not to talk to your kids about money from as young as
   three years old.

   This will help them:
     * Get the practice they need – learning how to manage money doesn’t
       happen overnight. Children need to build up their knowledge over
       time. They learn by taking lots of small steps and having
       opportunities to use money in real life.
     * Learn from their mistakes – this helps them to understand the
       consequences of the decisions they make. For example, if they spend
       all their money on sweets and can’t afford a new toy, they’re
       learning reasons to save but in a situation where the stakes are
       low.
     * Avoid money problems in the future – if you only start managing
       money when you’re an adult, the decisions you need to make usually
       involve bigger sums of money so the consequences of mistakes can be
       more severe.

   Back to top

You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money

   You play the most important role in helping your child develop the
   skills they need to manage money. If they see you make money decisions,
   they’re more likely to come to you with their questions.

   Your child will also be influenced by other people in their lives who
   may deal with money in a different way to you, for example,
   grandparents or friends at school. Or they may see adverts or content
   on social media that could influence their attitude to money. This is a
   great opportunity to encourage your child to think about why people
   make different decisions about money.

What is money?

   Mr Orangutan holding up a coin

   Here’s an exercise to help you understand how children see money:
     * Imagine an alien is visiting earth for the first time.
     * What would they think money is for?
     * How would they think it is used?

   As an adult you know exactly what is happening. Children (like the
   alien) don’t understand what money is and how it is used unless it is
   explained to them.
   Back to top

A little bit of preparation goes a long way

   It can be hard to know how to start a conversation about money, so it’s
   worth thinking about what you want to teach your child. This doesn’t
   have to be complicated — you could just decide the basic points you’d
   like to get across and the values or attitudes towards money you think
   are important to share.

   It’s also worth identifying what’s important to your family right now —
   it’s much more interesting for children to get involved in money
   decisions that affect them directly. For example, if you are saving up
   for a holiday you could show them some of things you’re cutting back on
   such as meals out or trips to the cinema.

Mental Health and Money: Guidance for supporting customers

   Published on:

   26 April 2023

   The Money and Pensions Service has produced a new guide that shows
   creditors how to offer more support to customers living with a mental
   health problem. Living with a mental health problem can make it more
   difficult to interact with and manage money, including payments to
   financial services providers, public sector creditors and utility
   providers.

How the Mental Health and Money guide was created

   ‘Mental Health and Money’ was created after detailed consultation with
   experts in both financial wellbeing and mental health.

   The guidance is supported by the Money and Mental Health Policy
   Institute, Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and Citizens Advice, along with
   Adferiad Recovery in Wales, MindWise in Northern Ireland and Scottish
   organisations Change Mental Health and Citizens Advice Scotland.

Why money matters in mental health

   Money and mental health are strongly linked, with research from the
   Money and Mental Health Policy Institute showing one in five people
   (18%) living with a mental health problem are also in problem debt.

What is money?

   24 November 2015 (updated on 20 June 2017)

   Euro banknotes and coins are money but so is the balance on a bank
   account. What actually is money? How is it created and what is the
   ECB’s role?
   Tell me: What is a central bank?

The changing essence of money

   The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually
   commodity money – an object made of something that had a market value,
   such as a gold coin. Later on, representative money consisted of
   banknotes that could be swapped against a certain amount of gold or
   silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat
   money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a
   central bank but, unlike representative money, cannot be converted
   into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. It has no intrinsic value –
   the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless – yet is still
   accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the
   central bank to keep the value of money stable over time. If central
   banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money would lose its general
   acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store
   of value.

The nature of money over time

   Present-day currency can also exist independently of a physical
   representation. Money can exist in a bank account in the form of a
   computer entry or stored in the form of a savings account. Digital
   cash, or e-money, is monetary value stored in a pre-paid card or
   smartphone, for example. And direct debits, internet payments and card
   transfers are all forms of payment that do not involve cash. (There are
   even newer decentralised digital currencies or virtual currency schemes
   like Bitcoin that exist without a central point of control like a
   central bank. These are not regarded as money from a legal
   perspective.)

   Despite the rapid rise in electronic payments, cash is still very
--
   the national central banks of the euro area countries, which together
   form the Eurosystem.

The uses of money and how the ECB keeps track of it

   Money, whatever its form, has three different functions. It is a medium
   of exchange – a means of payment with a value that everyone trusts.
   Money is also a unit of account allowing goods and services to be
   priced. And it is a store of value. Only a portion of euro cash in
   circulation actually circulates, i.e. is used for processing payments.
   For example, many of the circulating €50 notes are hoarded.

The functions of money

   Central banks usually define and monitor several monetary aggregates.
   Developments in these aggregates can reveal useful information about
   money and prices. Several aggregates are needed because many different
   financial assets are substitutable and the nature and characteristics
   of financial assets, transactions and means of payment change over
   time. The Eurosystem has defined a narrow (M1), an “intermediate” (M2)
--
   with a lot of other information and analyses, as part of its monetary
   policy strategy.

How is money created?

   The ECB acts as a bank for the commercial banks and this is also how it
   influences the flow of money and credit in the economy to achieve
   stable prices. Commercial banks, in turn, can borrow money, i.e.
   central bank reserves, from the ECB, usually to cover very short-term
   liquidity needs. The ECB’s main tool for controlling the quantity of
   “outside” money, and hence the demand for central bank reserves by
   commercial banks, is setting very short-term interest rates – the “cost
   of money”.

Money creation in the euro area

   Commercial banks can also create so-called “inside” money, i.e. bank
   deposits – this happens every time they issue a new loan. The
   difference between outside and inside money is that the former is an
   asset for the economy as a whole, but it is nobody’s liability. Inside
   money, on the other hand, is named this way because it is backed by
   private credit: if all the claims held by banks on private debtors were
   to be settled, the inside money created would be reversed to zero. So,
   it is one form of currency that is created – and can be reversed –
   within the private economy.

What about the ECB’s “money-printing” scheme I keep reading about?

   In practice, only the national central banks physically issue euro
   banknotes. “Money-printing” is the colloquial term for the ECB’s asset
   purchase programme, a form of “quantitative easing”. By purchasing
   assets in the financial market, the ECB creates additional central bank
   reserves that can help reduce – through a variety of channels – the
   interest rates faced by households and firms with a view to supporting
   the economy and, ultimately, to keep the value of money stable when the
   room to cut those interest rates directly controlled by the ECB is
   limited. In this process, the ECB does not actually print banknotes to
   pay for the assets but creates money electronically, which is credited
   to the seller or intermediary, e.g. a commercial bank. The seller can
   then use the additional liquidity to buy other assets or, in case of a
   commercial bank, extend credit to the real economy. The purchases

What Is Money? Definition, History, Types, and Creation

   Money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people for
   the payment of goods and services, as well as the repayment of loans.
   Money makes the world go 'round. Economies rely on money to facilitate
   transactions and to power financial growth. Typically, it is economists
   who define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. Here are
   the multifaceted characteristics of money.

Key Takeaways

     * Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people and businesses to
       obtain what they need to live and thrive.
     * Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods
       before money was created.
     * Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for
       most people it represents something valuable.
     * Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a
       physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government.
     * Above all, money is a unit of account - a socially accepted
       standard unit with which things are priced.

Medium of Exchange

   Before the development of a medium of exchange—that is, money—people
   would barter to obtain the goods and services they needed. Two
   individuals, each possessing some goods the other wanted, would enter
   into an agreement to trade.
--
   a trade requires coming to an agreement and devising a way to determine
   how many bananas are worth certain parts of the cow.

   Commodity money solved these problems. Commodity money is a type of
   good that functions as currency. In the 17th and early 18th centuries,
   for example, American colonists used beaver pelts and dried corn in
   transactions. Possessing generally accepted values, these commodities
--
   had certain characteristics: they were widely desired and, therefore,
   valuable, but they were also durable, portable, and easily stored.

   Another, more advanced example of commodity money is a precious metal
   such as gold. For centuries, gold was used to back paper currency—up
   until the 1970s. In the case of the U.S. dollar, for example, this
   meant that foreign governments were able to take their dollars and
--
   is beautiful. So, gold is something that has worth. Gold, therefore,
   serves as a physical token of wealth based on people's perceptions.

   This relationship between money and gold provides insight into how
   money gains its value—as a representation of something valuable.

Impressions Create Everything

   The second type of money is fiat money, which does not require backing
   by a physical commodity. Instead, the value of fiat currencies is set
   by supply and demand and people's faith in its worth. Fiat money
   developed because gold was a scarce resource, and rapidly growing
   economies growing couldn't always mine enough to back their currency
   supply requirements. For a booming economy, the need for gold to give
   money value is extremely inefficient, especially when its value is
   really created by people's perceptions.

   Fiat money becomes the token of people's perception of worth, the basis
   for why money is created. An economy that is growing is apparently
   succeeding in producing other things that are valuable to itself and
   other economies. The stronger the economy, the stronger its money will
   be perceived (and sought after) and vice versa. However, people's
   perceptions must be supported by an economy that can produce the
   products and services that people want.

   For example, beginning in 1971, the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold
   standard—the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold, and the price of
   gold was no longer fixed to any dollar amount. This was made official
   in 1976. This meant that it was now possible to create more paper money
   than there was gold to back it; the health of the U.S. economy backed
   the dollar's value. If the economy stalls, the value of the U.S. dollar
   will drop both domestically through inflation and internationally
--
   countries and entities are working tirelessly to ensure that never
   happens.

   Today, the value of money (not just the dollar, but most currencies) is
   decided purely by its purchasing power, as dictated by inflation. That
   is why simply printing new money will not create wealth for a country.
   Money is created by a kind of a perpetual interaction between real,
   tangible things, our desire for them, and our abstract faith in what
   has value. Money is valuable because we want it, but we want it only
   because it can get us a desired product or service.

How Is Money Measured?

   But exactly how much money is out there, and what forms does it take?
   Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there
   is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so
   that it is more discernible for measurement purposes:
     * M1 – This category of money includes all physical denominations of
       coins and currency; demand deposits, which are checking accounts
       and NOW accounts; and travelers' checks. It also includes other
       forms of liquid deposits and assets such as savings accounts. This
       category of money is the narrowest of the three, and is essentially
       the money used to buy things and make payments (see the "active
       money" section below).
     * M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money found
       in M1 to all time-related deposits, many types of retirement
       accounts, and non-institutional money market funds. This category
       represents money that can be readily transferred into cash.
     * M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found in
       the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits,
       institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements,
       along with other larger liquid assets. M3 indicates a country's
       money supply or the total amount of money within an economy.

Active Money

   The M1 category includes what's known as active money—the total value
   of coins and paper currency in circulation as well as liquid deposits
   and accounts. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally,
   monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, Federal Reserve Banks
   distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks lend
   money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is actively
   circulated.

   The variable demand for cash equates to a constantly fluctuating active
   money total. For example, people typically cash paychecks or withdraw
   from ATMs over the weekend, so there is more active cash on a Monday
   than on a Friday. The public demand for cash declines at certain
   times—following the December holiday season, for example.

How Money Is Created

   We have discussed why and how money, a representation of perceived
   value, is created in the economy, but another important factor
   concerning money and the economy is how a country's central bank (the
   central bank in the United States is the Federal Reserve or the Fed)
   can influence and manipulate the money supply.

   If the Fed wants to increase the amount of money in circulation,
   perhaps to boost economic activity, the central bank can, of course,
   print it. However, the physical bills are only a small part of the
   money supply.

   Another way for the central bank to increase the money supply is to buy
   government fixed-income securities in the market. When the central bank
   buys these government securities, it puts money into the marketplace,
   and effectively into the hands of the public. How does a central bank
   such as the Fed pay for this? As strange as it sounds, the central bank
   simply creates the money and transfers it to those selling the
   securities. Alternatively, the Fed can lower interest rates allowing
   banks to extend low-cost loans or credit—a phenomenon known as cheap
   money—and encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow and spend.

   To shrink the money supply, perhaps to reduce inflation, the central
   bank does the opposite and sells government securities. The money with
   which the buyer pays the central bank is essentially taken out of
   circulation. Keep in mind that we are generalizing in this example to
   keep things simple.

   A central bank cannot print money without end. If too much money is
   issued, the value of that currency will drop consistent with the law of
   supply and demand.

   Remember, as long as people have faith in the currency, a central bank
   can issue more of it. But if the Fed issues too much money, the value
   will go down, as with anything that has a higher supply than demand.
   Therefore, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants.

The History of American Money

Currency Wars

   In the 17th century, Great Britain was determined to keep control of
   both the American colonies and the natural resources they controlled.
   To do this, the British limited the money supply and made it illegal
   for the colonies to mint coins of their own. Instead, the colonies were
   forced to trade using English bills of exchange that could only be
   redeemed for English goods. Colonists were paid for their goods with
--
   out your knife and hacked it into eight bits. From this, we have the
   expression "two bits," meaning a quarter of a dollar.

Massachusetts Money

   Massachusetts was the first colony to defy the mother country. In 1652,
   the state minted its own silver coins including the Oak Tree and Pine
   Tree shillings. The state circumvented the British law stating that
   only the monarch of the British empire could issue coins by dating all
   their coins in 1652, a period when there was no monarch. In 1690,
   Massachusetts also issued the first paper money calling it bills of
   credit.

   Tensions between America and Britain continued to mount until the
   Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. The colonial leaders declared
   independence and created a new currency called Continentals to finance
   their side of the war. Unfortunately, each government printed as much
   money as it needed without backing it to any standard or asset, so the
   Continentals experienced rapid inflation and became worthless. This
   experience discouraged the American government from using paper money
   for almost a century.

Aftermath of the Revolution

   system a complete wreck. Most of the currencies in the newly formed
   United States of America were useless. The problem wasn't resolved
   until 13 years later in 1788 when Congress was granted constitutional
   powers to coin money and regulate its value. In 1792, the Coinage Act
   was passed establishing the first national mint which created a
   national monetary system and unit of money, the dollar. There was also
   a bimetallic standard, meaning that both silver and gold could be
   valued in and used to back paper dollars.

--
   advocated for gold. The situation was resolved in 1900 when the Gold
   Standard Act was passed, which made gold the sole backing for the
   dollar. This backing meant that, in theory, you could take your paper
   money and exchange it for the corresponding value in gold. In 1913, the
   Federal Reserve was created and given the power to steer the economy by
   controlling the money supply and interest rates on loans.

The Bottom Line

   Money has changed substantially since the days of shells and skins, but
   its main function hasn't changed at all. Regardless of what form it
   takes, money offers us a medium of exchange for goods and services and
   allows the economy to grow as transactions can be completed at greater
   speeds.

White House says money for Ukraine military aid is running out with Congress
divided on whether to provide more

   Anna Voitenko/Reuters
   CNN  —

   The White House made clear Friday that the amount of money the US has
   available for Ukraine military aid is quickly running out as House
   Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate remain at odds over the Biden
   administration’s multi-billion dollar request for more funding.

   A $425 million security package announced on Friday pushed the US to
   the limit on the money available to Kiev.

   “We are beginning to provide Ukraine with smaller [Presidential
   Drawdown Authority] packages in order to stretch out our ability to

   supplies to Kyiv.

   The Pentagon’s Chief Financial Officer, Michael McCord, warned in early
   October that USAI money had run out for the previous fiscal year,
   urging Congress to pass additional funding.  The $300 million was the
   only money available for USAI from the current Continuing Resolution
   funding the government.

   Can you blame them?

   After all, it's hard to be pumped about putting money away for a
   situation you hope will never actually arise. That's why, for people
   looking to bump up their savings, a change in mental accounting might
   be in order.

   "Everyone has their own version of what a rainy day means to them, but
   it always has that negative connotation," says Spenser Liszt, a
   certified financial planner and founder of Motif Planning. "With a
   topic that's so vulnerable, like money, it's important to encourage
   positive language so people can have positive experiences with their
   money."

   That's why, in addition to your traditional emergency fund, some
   financial pros recommend building a so-called sunny day fund of money
   you can spend guilt-free or put toward exciting opportunities.

   Here's how they say it could work.
--

How a 'sunny day' fund can help you reach your goals

   Much of financial planning is about setting money aside for defined
   goals, such as retirement. But other opportunities for your money will
   inevitably arise. And when they do, a sunny day fund could come in
   handy.

   What that looks like is up to you. Perhaps you want money on hand for
   short-term things that come up — say, an impromptu vacation with
   friends or a fun business opportunity. In that case, keep your sunny
   day fund in an income-producing cash account, the same way you would an
--
   If you want to save for something bigger and more amorphous — say you
   want a lavish anniversary celebration or plan to eventually take a
   yearlong sabbatical from work to write a novel — favor a taxable
   brokerage account. That will allow you to invest the money in assets
   that will ostensibly grow, but also withdraw funds whenever you need
   them without penalty.

--
   day comes sooner than you think, you can always tap your sunny day fund
   now and rebuild it later.

   "That money is fungible," Baxley says. "You can move money over from
   your sunny day fund to your emergency fund instantaneously these days."

What is 'Money'

   Money
   The money came into existence to overcome the drawbacks of the barter
   system. Earlier, people use to exchange goods and services as a form of
   commerce. This often led to many disadvantages, one of which was the
   double coincidence of wants. To solve this problem, a standard medium
   of exchange, money, was introduced.
   What is money?
   A medium of exchange that is centralized, generally accepted,
   recognized, and facilitates transactions of goods and services, is
   known as money.
     * Money is a medium of exchange for various goods and services in an
       economy.
     * The money system varies with the governments and countries.
     * Different countries have different currencies.
     * The central authority is responsible for monitoring the monetary
       system.
     * There are many forms of money, and cryptocurrency is the newest
       addition to the forms of money and can be internationally
       exchanged.

   Characteristics of Money
   Fungible currency: A currency must be fungible which means that the
   units used as a currency must be equal in quality and shall be
   interchangeable. A non-fungible form of currency is not considered
--
   one time. It should not be perishable. A perishable good or article
   should not be used as a currency because it cannot be used multiple
   times and also cannot be stored for future transactions. Therefore, to
   conserve the future-oriented use-value of the money, a currency must be
   durable.
   Easily recognizable: The users of the money must be ascertained of its
   authenticity. In other words, the currency must be universally
   recognized. An unrecognized currency or money leads to disagreement
   with the exchange terms. A recognized currency ensures trust in the
   money system as well as its acceptance.
   Stability: A currency must be stable in terms of value. In simple
   terms, money should have a constant or increasing value. Money cannot
   be unstable whose value keeps drastically changing. An unstable
   currency can give room to the risk of a sudden drop in value which can
   hamper the acceptance and authenticity of the money system.
   Portable: A currency must be portable and can be conveniently
   transported from one place to another. The money must be divisible into
   various quantities making its use better. Money if not portable can
   lead to an exceeded cost of transportation of the currency itself.
   Therefore, money should be able to be divided into further smaller
   units to facilitate smooth transactions of various quantities of goods.
   Secondly, it should be easily transferable and portable.
   Functions of Money
   Medium of exchange: Money is the generally accepted medium of exchange
   that is used to make all the transactions. Ex- payments of goods,
   payment of tax, etc.
   A measure of Value: Money expresses the value of every service as well
   as goods. Therefore, it is a common denomination.
   Standard of deferred payments: Money is considered the standard for
   future payments. Ex- The payment of the electricity bill on the
   upcoming due date.
   Store of value: It means that money is capable of being stored and
   transferring the purchasing power from today to the future. Ex: Using
   the money in a savings account to buy new furniture.
   Distribution of social income: Income can easily be distributed with
   the help of money. Ex: Distribution of total money earned by a school
   in the form of salaries, wages, utility bills, etc.
   Basis of Credit Creation: The "store of value" function of the money
   helps in credit creation by the banks. Ex: Using the money of demand
   deposits as a tool for credit creation.
   Liquidity: Money is the most liquid asset of the economy. Ex: Credit
   cards, debit cards, cash.
   Types of Money:
   The following are the types of money:
   Market Determined Money: Any good that can be generally accepted by the
   people of the economy to exchange it indirectly for various goods and
   services between different parties is called Market determined money.
   Fiat Money and Legal Tender: The form of money that is issued by the
   government and is not backed by any commodity is known as fiat money.
   Ex: INR, Dollar, Pounds, etc. The term legal tender states the money
   that is legally issued by the government. Ex: Coins and Banknotes.
   Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies are an electronic medium of exchange
   that exists virtually. Crypto is a peer-to-peer system that runs on the
   blockchain. In simple terms, it is an intangible form of currency and
   has opportunities for international exchange.
   What is the functional definition of money?
   The functional definition of money states that the money should be
   capable of bringing a generally accepted medium of exchange, the
   measure of value, the standard of deferred payment, and a store of
   value.
   How many functions of money are there?
   There are three functions of money: Primary, secondary, and other
   functions.
   What is Convertible Virtual Currency?
   Convertible virtual Currency is used as a substitute for the legal
   money accepted in the economy. These currencies can easily be exchanged
   for fiat money like cryptocurrencies.

   In general, the property you're buying with a mortgage is used to
   secure the loan - if you are unable to repay the debt, the lender can

   Some lenders may also accept a guarantee from a family member as

   This security can allow you to borrow a larger amount of money,

   repay the debt if ever you were to default and your own security

Did Fake Donors Give the Mayor Real Money? The F.B.I. Wants to Know.

   A search at the home of Mayor Eric Adams’s fund-raising chief sought
   information about a so-called straw donor scheme.

   chief fund-raiser, as part of an investigation into whether his
   campaign had received illegal foreign campaign contributions from the
   Turkish government and Turkish nationals, disguised as coming from U.S.
   donors who had not actually given their own money, according to a
   search warrant.

   And in July, six men were indicted in Manhattan in connection with a

   statement. “I want to be clear: I have no knowledge, direct or
   otherwise, of any improper fund-raising activity — and certainly not of
   any foreign money. We will of course work with officials to respond to
   inquiries, as appropriate — as we always have.”

   The inquiries also raise questions about whether Mr. Adams’s campaign

   In New York City, small donations are particularly appealing. A
   generous matching program provides $8 in public funds for every $1
   donated. That turns the maximum matched donation of $250 into $2,250, a
   potential enticement for anyone seeking to multiply their money.

   “That’s probably the dumbest way to try to funnel money into trying to
   influence a candidate,” said John Kaehny, the executive director of the
   government watchdog group Reinvent Albany. “They’re all looked at by
   the Campaign Finance Board, which has the most extensive vetting and

   Ten years ago, John Liu, the city comptroller at the time, was a top
   contender for mayor when an investigation into his campaign uncovered a
   scheme to funnel money through straw donors.

   Two of his former associates were convicted in the scheme in 2013,
   including Jia Hou, a former Liu campaign treasurer who was in her 20s.

   Chris Coffey, a Democratic political strategist and Mr. Yang’s campaign
   manager, said donors did not always understand that it was illegal to
   contribute money in someone else’s name.

   “Donors are often oblivious to campaign finance,” he said. “They think
   it’s like donating to a charity where you can be reimbursed. It’s added

   in the world probably have handled money, many of them on a daily
   basis. But despite its familiarity, probably few people could tell you
   exactly what money is, or how it works.

   In short, money can be anything that can serve as a
   • store of value, which means people can save it and use it
       later—smoothing their purchases over time;
       • unit of account, that is, provide a common base for prices; or
--

   Perhaps the easiest way to think about the role of money is to consider
   what would change if we did not have it.

   If there were no money, we would be reduced to a barter economy. Every
   item someone wanted to purchase would have to be exchanged for
   something that person could provide. For example, a person who
   specialized in fixing cars and needed to trade for food would have to
--
   specialize. People might starve before they were able to find the right
   person with whom to barter.

   But with money, you don’t need to find a particular person. You just
   need a market in which to sell your goods or services. In that market,
   you don’t barter for individual goods. Instead you exchange your goods
   or services for a common medium of exchange—that is, money. You can
   then use that money to buy what you need from others who also accept
   the same medium of exchange. As people become more specialized, it is
   easier to produce more, which leads to more demand for transactions
   and, hence, more demand for money.

Many monies

   To put it a different way, money is something that holds its value over
   time, can be easily translated into prices, and is widely accepted.
   Many different things have been used as money over the years—among
   them, cowry shells, barley, peppercorns, gold, and silver.

   At first, the value of money was anchored by its alternative uses, and
   the fact that there were replacement costs. For example, you could eat
   barley or use peppercorns to flavor food. The value you place on such
   consumption provides a floor for the value. Anyone could grow more, but
   it does take time, so if the barley is eaten the supply of money
   declines. On the other hand, many people may want strawberries and be
   happy to trade for them, but they make poor money because they are
   perishable. They are difficult to save for use next month, let alone
   next year, and almost impossible to use in trade with people far away.
   There is also the problem of divisibility—not everything of value is
   easily divided, and standardizing each unit is also tricky; for
   example, the value of a basket of strawberries measured against
   different items is not easy to establish and keep constant. Not only do
   strawberries make for bad money, most things do.

   But precious metals seemed to serve all three needs: a stable unit of
   account, a durable store of value, and a convenient medium of exchange.
--
   They stand up to time well. They are easily divisible into standardized
   coins and do not lose value when made into smaller units. In short,
   their durability, limited supply, high replacement cost, and
   portability made precious metals more attractive as money than other
   goods.

   Until relatively recently, gold and silver were the main currency
--
   deposits. Anyone who wanted to could go to the bank and get the
   precious metal that backs the note. Eventually, the paper claim on the
   precious metal was delinked from the metal. When that link was broken,
   fiat money was born. Fiat money is materially worthless, but has value
   simply because a nation collectively agrees to ascribe a value to it.
   In short, money works because people believe that it will. As the means
   of exchange evolved, so did its source—from individuals in barter, to
   some sort of collective acceptance when money was barley or shells, to
   governments in more recent times.

   Even though using standardized coins or paper bills made it easier to
   determine prices of goods and services, the amount of money in the
   system also played an important role in setting prices. For example, a
   wheat farmer would have at least two reasons for holding money: to use
   in transactions (cash in advance) and as a buffer against future needs
   (precautionary saving). Suppose winter is coming and the farmer wants
   to add to his store of money in anticipation of future expenses. If the
   farmer has a hard time finding people with money who want to buy wheat,
   he may have to accept fewer coins or bills in exchange for the grain.
   The result is that the price of wheat goes down because the supply of
   money is too tight. One reason might be that there just isn’t enough
   gold to mint new money. When prices as a whole go down, it is called
   deflation. On the other hand, if there is more money in circulation but
   the same level of demand for goods, the value of the money will drop.
   This is inflation—when it takes more money to get the same amount of
   goods and services (see “What Is Inflation?” in the March 2010 issue of
   F&amp;D). Keeping the demand for and supply of money balanced can be
   tricky.

Manufacturing money

   How money is measured

   Fiat money is more efficient to use than precious metals. Adjustments
   to its supply do not depend on the amount of precious metal around. But
   that adds its own complication: Precisely because there is a finite
   amount of precious metals, there is a limit on the amount of notes that
   can be issued. If there is no gold or silver to back money, how do
   governments know how much to print? That gets into the dilemmas
   governments face. On the one hand, the authorities will always be
   tempted to issue money, because governments can buy more with it, hire
   more people, pay more wages, and increase their popularity. On the
   other hand, printing too much money starts to push up prices. If people
   start expecting that prices will continue to rise, they may increase
   their own prices even faster. Unless the government acts to rein in
   expectations, trust in money will be eroded, and it may eventually
   become worthless. That is what happens during hyperinflation. To remove
   this temptation to print money willy-nilly, most countries today have
   delegated the task of deciding how much money to print to independent
   central banks, which are charged with making the call based on their
   assessment of the economy’s needs and do not transfer funds to the
   government to finance its spending (see “What Is Monetary Policy?” in
   the September 2009 issue of F&amp;D). The term “printing money” is
   something of a misnomer in itself. Most money today is in the form of
   bank deposits rather than paper currency (see box).

Belief can fade

   Countries that have been down the path of high inflation experienced
   firsthand how the value of money essentially depends on people
   believing in it. In the 1980s, people in some Latin American countries,
   such as Argentina and Brazil, gradually lost confidence in the
   currency, because inflation was eroding its value so rapidly. They
   started using a more stable one, the U.S. dollar, as the de facto
   currency. This phenomenon is called unofficial, or de facto,
   dollarization. The government loses its monopoly on issuing money—and
   dollarization can be very difficult to reverse.

   Some policies governments have used to restore confidence in a currency
   nicely highlight the “faith” part of money functioning. In Turkey, for
   example, the government rebased the currency, the lira, eliminating six
   zeros in 2005. Overnight, 1,000,000 liras became 1 lira. Brazil, on the
   other hand, introduced a new currency in 1994, the real. In both
   countries, citizens went along, demonstrating that as long as everyone
   accepts that a different denomination or a new currency is the norm, it
   simply will be. Just like fiat money. If it is accepted as money, it is
   money. ■

Love, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids

   parents seek to achieve this ambition varies enormously. For instance,
   American and Chinese parents are increasingly authoritative and
   authoritarian, whereas Scandinavian parents tend to be more permissive.
   Why? Love, Money, and Parenting investigates how economic forces and
   growing inequality shape how parents raise their children. From
   medieval times to the present, and from the United States, the United
   Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden to China and Japan, Matthias
   Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how economic incentives and
   constraints—such as money, knowledge, and time—influence parenting
   practices and what is considered good parenting in different countries.
   Through personal anecdotes and original research, Doepke and Zilibotti
   show that in countries with increasing economic inequality, such as the
--
   childhood development and the design of education systems factor into
   the parenting equation, and how economics can help shape policies that
   will contribute to the ideal of equal opportunity for all.

Claim your money back

     * Thread starter GeogeHalin

   Hello!
   My mom called me this morning and asked me to do grocery shopping for
   her. She had not given me the money so she suggested I use my own
   pocket money to do the shopping and she would give the money back to me
   when she returned home. This is what she said:
   1. Please do the grocery shopping. You can claim your money back.
   That sounds quite odd to me.
   Do native speakers use it in this way?
   If not, what do you say?

   It's definitely odd in the context of doing shopping for your mother,

   What about if my boss asks me to buy a coffee for him and he promises

   Since it would be more or less in the nature of a social request, it's
   the same principle as your mother's shopping: "I'll give you the money
   back".
   If on the other hand the office has run out of pens, he might ask you
   to go out to the shops and buy some, get a receipt and then "You can
   claim your money back".

   I agree with DonnyB.
   "You can claim your money back" sounds too formal and a bit abstract
   for a personal arrangement.
   It does not say WHERE the money can be claimed back from thus hinting
   that it isn't necessarily the person who is saying it.
   Using "claimed" might suggest that a request would have to be be
   submitted eg fill in a formal expense or petty cash claim form and

   In AE, we would be much more likely to say "I'll pay you back."
   "I'll give you your money back" sounds as though I had your money in
   the first place: perhaps you gave me some money to buy something for
   you, and I couldn't do so. That's when I'd use that phrase.

   There is a phrase in persian that conveys the idea of borrowing money
   from someone and never give it back to him.
   the exact translation is "Has somebody ever eaten your money?"

   That's a good saying! The nearest I can think of would be "to be a
   money-pit" and it is usually used of things rather than people.
   e.g. John was building his own aeroplane, so far it had cost him
   $200,000 and the project was only half-finished. He could have bought a
   new and better aeroplane for $300,000 - the project was a money pit.
   Of people, there is the phrase, "to be high-maintenance" e.g. John
   regretted giving Jane the use of his credit card. She had turned out to
   be a high-maintenance girlfriend; she spent over $1,000 a week on

   We do burn money though, meaning spending too much and without any

   Thank you guys. But there's a little difference between what you said
   and what I actually meant by eating money.
   Let me put it this way.
   Ali: Hey, did you manage to get your money back from the guy who
   borrowed it 3 months ago?
   Darius: Nope! He ate my money and disappeared. He took advantage of my
   friendship and my trust.
   The idea I'm trying to convey here, is the fact that some people,
   borrow some money from you, or get a certain amount of it from you with
   the promise of a good investment along with a huge profit. but after a
   while it turns out that they fooled you and disappeared with your
   money.
   In this case, Persian people say "He ate your money"
   What do you guys say in English?

   of job offers for precisely this reason and I'm wondering if I should

   I'd really like to know why so many agencies prefer to pay via PayPal
   rather than bank transfer - can anyone shed some light on that please?
   All I know is that sending money via PayPal is free and some banks
   charge commission for international transfers (although I've never
   incurred any, neither when sending nor when receiving money). In fact
   an agency in Spain said that they do get charged high rates - so I
   guess every country is different? I really think there must be more
   advantages for the companies sending the money - is it extremely
   time-saving for example? At the moment I can only see the disadvantages
   for me and I'd like to understand both sides of the argument.

   accept transfers in their currencies without charges.
   What fees are concerned, it's a compromise to consider. If the fees
   make the job unprofitable, then I would refuse it. If you can earn
   enough money working for clients that don’t require Paypal, then you
   can turn them down. Otherwise, it's simply a part of normal and

   So, essentially, there is only PayPal and Skrill. Skrill is cheaper
   (even if you tell your client that he can deduct the Skrill fee off
   your invoice) but does not work in the USA.
   Other options for money sending include:
   * Western Union (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money
   in person, can take several days for transfer)
   * Moneygram (fees difficult to calculate, must often pick up money in
   person, can take several days for transfer)
   * WorldRemit (somewhat limited number of country-to-country
   combinations, USD 4 per transaction)

   Must have a thick skin and enjoy running about in the park! I tell

   year old girls (they rarely foul each other) have fun outside on a

   I work at an auto parts store on the weekends. It started off as a
   summer job in college. I worked full time during the summers and part
   time during the semesters. I just continued working there even after I
   graduated. I enjoy it, it puts extra money in my pocket, and I get a
   really big discount on parts, which I've used countless times and has

   A friend buys up land with timber.  He typically is dealing with
   uneducated people who need money fast and have no clue of  the value of
   the timber. He can buy the land for $40k cash, thin the land and get
   $50k in timber and then subdivide the land. This is not his full time

   more money, how do we say that in English? In other words, imagine you

   buy the ORE, even if I put low price to the stuff.
   Any way I can make a ship transport energy cells there? A cheap way,
   because I dont think I can afford to buy a ship. I have serious
   problems making money here, takes me lot of runs thru many stations,
   buying and selling to do few thousands, I dont think I can buy
   expensive staff such as mineral scanner or trading system extension,
   since I barelly have money for myself.
   Any early game making money tips?

   As long as you have money to buy energy cells, you can buy or use a

   The ship or fighter needs Trade 1 and 2 installed and supply software.

   transport ships. However, I'm pretty sure those ships are limited to
   only buying resources the station needs, it's not possible to set them
   to automatically sell its products.
   However, you can pretty much always make money on stations in BTF
   because of the way the pricing structure is laid out--even if you set
   your ore to sell at the lowest possible price (to undercut the
   competition), you can still make a profit.

   file if you use it. A free program called Notepad++ is a good option to
   edit them, linked below. Match the money in both or you will restart
   and find the money back to where it was. Also make sure you use the
   correct Save number file. Just put the exact amount you should have, no
   messing or guesswork involved. Not worth cheating. I never put in more
   than I should have. Only adjust it if the system rips me off.

   played 3 different maps before, until I started Westbridge Hills a week
   or so ago..I have enjoyed this just as much as every before..and I have
   not cheated in a single dollar. I collected the gold nuggets(just by
   looking around for the first 10..), and used the money to buy the Big
   Bud 450 and a larger cultivator and seeder, and hay equipment. Since
   then, I've just been farming away, slowly gaining money. As I said

Re: Best way to lose money

     * Quote

   played 3 different maps before, until I started Westbridge Hills a week
   or so ago..I have enjoyed this just as much as every before..and I have
   not cheated in a single dollar. I collected the gold nuggets(just by
   looking around for the first 10..), and used the money to buy the Big
   Bud 450 and a larger cultivator and seeder, and hay equipment. Since
   then, I've just been farming away, slowly gaining money. As I said
   above, I've found this to be the most enjoyable way to play, and I've
   played a lot across 4 versions of the game.

   brackets can be put into

   brackets, right?
   As for your question red- the fastest way to lose money is to pay off
   what you can of your loan, then buy and sell equipment till you're
   close to the amount you want</text>

   My English is not good, so I can't write unique seo optimization
   articles for the adsense site. And i havn`t money for buy articles. So
   how I can earn some money for example 50-100$ in a month?
   I have some technics skills in wordpress, seo (in my native language),
   but English is poor, so I don't feel better to go on Odesk as a
   freelancer, where is a high competition.
   So I think about to create sites which have non unique content and to
   promote it in social networks. But i dont know is this good idea.
   So what I can to do for making money in such condition? Sorry for my
   stupid question.

       Create sites for people that speak your native language. Not all
       websites have to be in English in order to make money. If you can
       write fluently in your native language, then you can earn money.
       Sure the traffic may not be as much as English sites but you should
       be able to make a little side income with a site in a different
       language.
       Also, you can teach others how to speak your home language on
       Fiverr or by starting your own membership course. Teach others how
       to speak fluently in your language and you could be making some
       decent money.

            Nobody interesting in Ukranian or especially Russian, today.
            Besides, I think where are a lot people who doing like this.
            So competition is high.

                      Find the money to pay for ads instead of focusing
                      your attention on article marketing. That way, you
                      will get results faster with paid ads.

       Don't focus on adsense. It's really hard to earn something on
       adsense. Stick with you skills. I'm sure also reliable wordpress
       services are much appreciated. Use the money to grow your own
       business. But I think it's really hard to earn with adsense these
       days from the beginning! Hope they end the war soon!!
       good luck!

       Actually to earn as your target $50 to $100 it is not a big amount.
       Anyone can earn this amount easily form the online sector. If you
       know the Wordpress &amp; SEO, it is a good chance to earn the money.
       You will be able to earn by using the Wordpress &amp; SEO. beside
       these, you should learn ENGLISH. because it is international
       Language.

                 I am also on the same boat. I am non-native English

   Most financial planners make their money by managing assets and taking

   of millions of dollars and extract a small percentage of that asset

   of whom were around 18-25 and did not have a lot of financial literacy.
   I tried to address that and had certified financial planners come and
   give classes but most of it didn't stick. We were deploying and many of
   them would be making a lot more money and have lots of tax advantages
   like a savings account that paid 10% interest (a few years ago when a
   high-yield savings account paid 2% at best). I could barely get any of
   my Soldiers to participate in that - or contribute tax-free pay to a
   Roth IRA. Even the basics of just putting in enough money to their 401k
   to get the free 5% match was a challenge. I drove a car that cost $3k
   and was making more money than almost any of them. But they would come
   to drill in trucks that cost $40k+ while working a job making less than
   that per year.

   Hello, I have some saving accounts in France and I do have to fill up a
   self assessment in order to pay my taxes on the interests in the UK. If
   I wanted to transfer some money from my French bank account to my
   English bank account, do I have to declare or mention it somewhere?
   Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of money I am transferring to
   the Uk? And what is the maximum amount I can transfer in one go? Thank
   you

   I’m a Canadian citizen, resident in the UK and wish to transfer monies
   from Canada to the UK. The money was left to me by my late mother and
   relevant taxes have been paid in Canada. It’s not income so I can’t see
   that I’d need to pay income tax on the UK on it ? Would this be correct

   planning on transfering money to my account in another UK bank, and
   neither of these accounts are joint accounts (I am not in his accound
   and he is not in mine). Will he or myself have to pay any taxes on that
   transfer? If so, is there a limit in the money transfered above which I
   will get taxed? Thanks for your help in advance.

   Hello, I am just arrived at the UK. I am arranging to move money from

   used towards the purchase of a residential house for my son in the UK.
   He is currently a non-resident and will be a tax-resident in the year
   2021-2022. Need my son or I pay UK tax for the money transfer? Does it
   require for any declaration of the transfer to the HMRC? Will there be
   any difference if the money transfer between our accounts (UK accounts)
   occur before and after financial year cut-off of 5April2021? Thank you.

   The federal agency that administers Social Security benefits is making
   new efforts to reclaim overpayments, and it may try to claw back money

   Roughly 0.5% of Social Security payments are overpayments, according to
   the agency. Overpayments can either be the government’s fault or the
   result of a mistake by the beneficiary. Either way, the result is that
   beneficiaries owe money back to the government.

Government to track down Social Security overpayments

   It is unclear how much money the government is trying to collect in

   trying to collect $21 billion in Social Security overpayments, as some
   media reports suggested.

   plans are stressing the budgets of some affected beneficiaries as the

   You can file an appeal or make a request that the Social Security
   Administration not seek the money back. The agency also said it’s

   Home Betting Betfair Scalper Review Scalping Course

Profits Using Profits Maximiser Programme

--


   From Home Business Direct (homebusinessdirect.co.uk) Using your
   computer, you will be taught how to take advantage of how much money is
   entering the Betfair market at specific times BEFORE an event. Using
   the fact that most people who use Betfair have no idea what they are
   doing, users of Betfair Scalper will be able to set ‘traps’ to
   manipulate where the money is going, and then consistently make
   multiple profits throughout the day, without anybody even noticing.
   What you will be doing, is scalping, or creaming a percentage of the
   money being placed BEFORE an event has even taken place.

How does Betfair Scalper work?

--
   liquidity entering the market before the main activity starts, and
   definitely before the race begins.

   Scalping is quite a relaxed way of making money compared to many of the
   systems out there. It is simply a case of time that you have to invest
   after you learn how it is done.

--

   £89.97 – Although when considering how much the investment is, as
   always, you will need to weigh up the earning potential of what is
   being offered, as well as the money back guarantee offered by the
   vendor. There are many Betfair products online that don’t come anywhere
   near to the quality that this scalping course offers, and continues to
   be increased almost daily.
--
   account

   Scalping is a very good way of producing profits on a daily basis when
   you have learned how it works, as you are taking small amounts of money
   from the betting exchanges on every race, so it is really is up to you
   as to how much time you wish to spend doing this.

   when trying to make a profit from Betfair, and this is one of them

Conclusion on The Betfair Scalping Course

   This is an excellent product, and as long as you have a Windows
   computer, then together with the money back guarantee, you have nothing
   to lose really. Remember though, that as with any trading opportunity,
   you can only make money if you have the time to dedicate yourself to
   what is being taught.

   Without giving the information away ( which could also confuse ) the
   scalping method entails laying ‘traps’ in the market around 10 minutes
   before the race when the market is fairly static and then capitalising
   before the start of each race when the liquidity (money) floods into
   the market creating movement on the price.

   Hiya, I signed up for this betfair course and I really like it. I have
   read a lot over the years about how to make money from betfair but this
   really ticked the right boxes on what to actually do. I am not trading
   live yet as I am still practising but if you are interested in a proper
   instruction it is the best I have come across so far by a distance. I
   will report back when I trade on the live side but I can some big
   potential with this scalper trading.

   Coming from match betting this was good for me as all my bonuses were
   drying up and finding it harder to make money. This scalping course has
   been excellent so far. I started it the last week in feb and starting
   to make some consistent profits already. Today for example I have
   already done £68 which I am well pleased with.

   You won’t go wrong with this one.

   Stuart is one of the best trainers I have come across in a long while.
   It taught me how to use the software also, which I needed, and steadily
   making some money with it after learning it all. Just one thing I would
   like to say. There is a LOT of videos and learning to do but it is all
   done in a nice way, I really enjoyed the videos. Start small and then
   increase that is what I did and it is working really well for me know.

   Made money back easily on the first day. Last month on this, I made

   After trying to make money on the internet for the last 3 years, profit

   facebook group but was declined because I was not a member.

   However I finally joined profit maximiser last week and I wish I had
   done so sooner. So easy is the money to make that I thought something
   was not right at first. I am now a member of the said facebook group
   now I have joined, and the amount of people on there making money is
   ridiculous. Lots of people making extremely good money with this
   product.

   A happy chap also here and I now wish I started it a few months ago
   instead of messing around.

   I say if you have not yet joined this, then you are losing out on some
   very, very easy money to be had.

   Just to be clear you need to live in the UK or Ireland to profit from
   this system ? or can you be living outside the US to make money with
   this system.
   Sounds very interesting please let me know so that I can purchase this
   method.

   Hiya. Just wanted to show my appreciation for sending this info my way.
   It was about 4 months ago actually I got the product from make money
   forum, and very pleased I did.

   I made £840 last month with it. You read that right £840 just by
   following the information GIVEN to you in the membership area. Last
   month I made £425, and similar the first month. If you don’t take this
   easy money then you must be rocking, best thing I ever did money wise,
   and believe me, I have tried everything to make a few quid.

   Hello Maureen,

   As money is involved Betfair do need to verify accounts sometimes,
   although for most they don’t.

   It might be worth asking a family member if they can help you to verify

   Hello Abdeen,

   We are not going to apologise for for showing and reviewing products
   that definitely make money. Profit Maximiser is NOT gambling in any
   way, and there is now a £20K club for many of customers who use this
   product who have made well over £20,000+ a year.

   programme was the communication from Mike who runs it. First class
   product and first class communication.

   I really do recommend his product. Easy, easy money to be made with
   this one, which is a rare thing to say in this day and age folks!

   I have never tried anything like this before, and was skeptical, but I
   needn’t be, because Mike who runs it all is VERY helpful to newbies,
   and since starting I have made around £640. Yep, it does make some
   seriously good money, and there is no risk. My wife does some of the
   stuff for me too, and she didn’t believe I was making the money. She
   loves it now, and the money hahaha

   Honestly, even if you have not tried anything like this before, it will
   make you some good money.

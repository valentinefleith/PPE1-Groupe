Supporting your child to build a healthy relationship with money doesn’t happen overnight. Talking openly and practising in real life will help your child to pick up the skills they need. Talking to children about money can be difficult arrow icon -- Mr Orangutan asking himself a question It’s never too early to talk money Mr Orangutan asking himself a question We want our children to grow up feeling confident about managing money. However, it’s often difficult to talk about money – it can be an emotional topic, especially if you have had your own issues with it or feel you would say the wrong thing. You may feel that money discussions are better left until your child is older. But this can stop them from developing the skills they need to look after their money in the long term. [209]Back to top It’s easier than you think The good news is you don’t have to manage your own money perfectly to be able to teach your children good habits. You just need to decide what you want to teach them and keep it simple. -- Start when your child is still young Our habits around money can start to form from around the age of seven. This includes whether you spend money straight away or like to save up. Children learn not just from what you tell them but from what they see you doing, so starting early helps to build good habits. There’s no reason not to talk to your kids about money from as young as three years old. This will help them: concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Get the practice they need – learning how to manage money doesn’t happen overnight. Children need to build up their knowledge over time. They learn by taking lots of small steps and having opportunities to use money in real life. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Learn from their mistakes – this helps them to understand the consequences of the decisions they make. For example, if they spend all their money on sweets and can’t afford a new toy, they’re learning reasons to save but in a situation where the stakes are low. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Avoid money problems in the future – if you only start managing money when you’re an adult, the decisions you need to make usually involve bigger sums of money so the consequences of mistakes can be more severe. [211]Back to top You have the most influence on your child’s attitude to money You play the most important role in helping your child develop the skills they need to manage money. If they see you make money decisions, they’re more likely to come to you with their questions. Your child will also be influenced by other people in their lives who may deal with money in a different way to you, for example, grandparents or friends at school. Or they may see adverts or content on social media that could influence their attitude to money. This is a great opportunity to encourage your child to think about why people make different decisions about money. arrow icon warning icon calculator icon arrow icon Mr Orangutan holding up a coin What is money? Mr Orangutan holding up a coin Here’s an exercise to help you understand how children see money: concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Imagine an alien is visiting earth for the first time. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh What would they think money is for? concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh How would they think it is used? As an adult you know exactly what is happening. Children (like the alien) don’t understand what money is and how it is used unless it is explained to them. [212]Back to top -- A little bit of preparation goes a long way It can be hard to know how to start a conversation about money, so it’s worth thinking about what you want to teach your child. This doesn’t have to be complicated — you could just decide the basic points you’d like to get across and the values or attitudes towards money you think are important to share. It’s also worth identifying what’s important to your family right now — it’s much more interesting for children to get involved in money decisions that affect them directly.

	<text>concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh What is money? 24 November 2015 (updated on 20 June 2017) Euro banknotes and coins are money but so is the balance on a bank account. What actually is money? How is it created and what is the ECB’s role? [36]Tell me: What is a central bank? The changing essence of money The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually commodity money – an object made of something that had a market value, such as a gold coin. Later on, representative money consisted of banknotes that could be swapped against a certain amount of gold or silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a central bank but, unlike representative money, cannot be converted into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. It has no intrinsic value – the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless – yet is still accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the central bank to keep the value of money stable over time. If central banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money would lose its general acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store of value. The nature of money over time Present-day currency can also exist independently of a physical representation. Money can exist in a bank account in the form of a computer entry or stored in the form of a savings account. Digital cash, or e-money, is monetary value stored in a pre-paid card or smartphone, for example. And direct debits, internet payments and card transfers are all forms of payment that do not involve cash. (There are even newer decentralised digital currencies or [37]virtual currency schemes like Bitcoin that exist without a central point of control like a central bank. These are not regarded as money from a legal perspective.) -- form the Eurosystem. The uses of money and how the ECB keeps track of it Money, whatever its form, has three different functions. It is a medium -- For example, many of the circulating €50 notes are hoarded. The functions of money Central banks usually define and monitor several monetary aggregates. Developments in these aggregates can reveal useful information about money and prices. Several aggregates are needed because many different financial assets are substitutable and the nature and characteristics of financial assets, transactions and means of payment change over -- policy strategy. How is money created? The ECB acts as a bank for the commercial banks and this is also how it influences the flow of money and credit in the economy to achieve stable prices. Commercial banks, in turn, can borrow money, i.e. central bank reserves, from the ECB, usually to cover very short-term liquidity needs. The ECB’s main tool for controlling the quantity of “outside” money, and hence the demand for central bank reserves by commercial banks, is setting very short-term interest rates – the “cost of money”. Money creation in the euro area Commercial banks can also create so-called “inside” money, i.e. bank deposits – this happens every time they issue a new loan. The difference between outside and inside money is that the former is an asset for the economy as a whole, but it is nobody’s liability. Inside money, on the other hand, is named this way because it is backed by private credit: if all the claims held by banks on private debtors were to be settled, the inside money created would be reversed to zero. So, it is one form of currency that is created – and can be reversed – within the private economy. What about the ECB’s “money-printing” scheme I keep reading about? In practice, only the national central banks physically issue euro -- reserves that can help reduce – through a variety of channels – the interest rates faced by households and firms with a view to supporting the economy and, ultimately, to keep the value of money stable when the room to cut those interest rates directly controlled by the ECB is limited. In this process, the ECB does not actually print banknotes to pay for the assets but creates money electronically, which is credited to the seller or intermediary, e.g. a commercial bank. The seller can then use the additional liquidity to buy other assets or, in case of a -- Here is a challenge for you! Test how much you know about money with this interactive quiz.

	<text>Money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people for the payment of goods and services, as well as the repayment of loans. Money makes the world go 'round. Economies rely on money to facilitate transactions and to power financial growth. Typically, it is economists who define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. Here are the multifaceted characteristics of money. Key Takeaways -- obtain what they need to live and thrive. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods before money was created. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for most people it represents something valuable. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Above all, money is a unit of account - a socially accepted standard unit with which things are priced. -- Before the development of a [167]medium of exchange—that is, money—people would barter to obtain the goods and services they needed. Two individuals, each possessing some goods the other wanted, would enter into an agreement to trade. -- how many bananas are worth certain parts of the cow. [168]Commodity money solved these problems. Commodity money is a type of good that functions as currency. In the 17th and early 18th centuries, for example, American colonists used beaver pelts and dried -- easily stored. Another, more advanced example of commodity money is a precious metal such as gold. For centuries, gold was used to back paper currency—up until the 1970s. In the case of the U.S. dollar, for example, this -- serves as a physical token of wealth based on people's perceptions. This relationship between money and gold provides insight into how money gains its value—as a representation of something valuable. Impressions Create Everything The second type of money is [169]fiat money, which does not require backing by a physical commodity. Instead, the value of fiat currencies is set by supply and demand and people's faith in its worth. Fiat money developed because gold was a scarce resource, and rapidly growing economies growing couldn't always mine enough to back their currency supply requirements. For a booming economy, the need for gold to give money value is extremely inefficient, especially when its value is really created by people's perceptions. Fiat money becomes the token of people's perception of worth, the basis for why money is created. An economy that is growing is apparently succeeding in producing other things that are valuable to itself and other economies. The stronger the economy, the stronger its money will be perceived (and sought after) and vice versa. However, people's perceptions must be supported by an economy that can produce the -- standard—the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold, and the price of gold was no longer fixed to any dollar amount. This was made official in 1976. This meant that it was now possible to create more paper money than there was gold to back it; the health of the U.S. economy backed the dollar's value. If the economy stalls, the value of the U.S. dollar -- happens. Today, the value of money (not just the dollar, but most currencies) is decided purely by its [170]purchasing power, as dictated by inflation. That is why simply printing new money will not create wealth for a country. Money is created by a kind of a perpetual interaction between real, tangible things, our desire for them, and our abstract faith in -- How Is Money Measured? But exactly how much money is out there, and what forms does it take? Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so that it is more discernible for measurement purposes: concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh [171]M1 – This category of money includes all physical denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers' checks. It also includes other forms of liquid deposits and assets such as savings accounts. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments (see the "active money" section below). concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh [172]M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money found in M1 to all time-related deposits, many types of retirement accounts, and non-institutional money market funds. This category represents money that can be readily transferred into cash. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh [173]M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, along with other larger liquid assets. M3 indicates a country's money supply or the total amount of money within an economy. Active Money The M1 category includes what's known as active money—the total value of coins and paper currency in circulation as well as liquid deposits and accounts. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally, monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, [174]Federal Reserve Banks distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks lend money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is actively circulated. The variable demand for cash equates to a constantly fluctuating active money total. For example, people typically cash paychecks or withdraw from ATMs over the weekend, so there is more active cash on a Monday than on a Friday. The public demand for cash declines at certain -- How Money Is Created We have discussed why and how money, a representation of perceived value, is created in the economy, but another important factor concerning money and the economy is how a country's central bank (the central bank in the United States is the Federal Reserve or the Fed) can influence and manipulate the money supply. If the Fed wants to increase the amount of money in circulation, perhaps to boost economic activity, the central bank can, of course, print it. However, the physical bills are only a small part of the money supply. Another way for the central bank to increase the money supply is to buy government fixed-income securities in the market. When the central bank buys these government securities, it puts money into the marketplace, and effectively into the hands of the public. How does a central bank such as the Fed pay for this? As strange as it sounds, the central bank simply creates the money and transfers it to those selling the securities. Alternatively, the Fed can lower [175]interest rates allowing banks to extend low-cost loans or credit—a phenomenon known as cheap money—and encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow and spend. To shrink the money supply, perhaps to reduce inflation, the central bank does the opposite and sells government securities. The money with which the buyer pays the central bank is essentially taken out of circulation. Keep in mind that we are generalizing in this example to keep things simple. A central bank cannot print money without end. If too much money is issued, the value of that currency will drop consistent with the law of supply and demand. Remember, as long as people have faith in the currency, a central bank can issue more of it. But if the Fed issues too much money, the value will go down, as with anything that has a higher supply than demand. Therefore, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants. The History of American Money -- In the 17th century, Great Britain was determined to keep control of both the American colonies and the natural resources they controlled. To do this, the British limited the money supply and made it illegal for the colonies to mint coins of their own. Instead, the colonies were forced to trade using English bills of exchange that could only be -- only the monarch of the British empire could issue coins by dating all their coins in 1652, a period when there was no monarch. In 1690, Massachusetts also issued the first paper money calling it bills of credit. -- independence and created a new currency called [176]Continentals to finance their side of the war. Unfortunately, each government printed as much money as it needed without backing it to any standard or asset, so the Continentals experienced rapid inflation and became worthless. This experience discouraged the American government from using paper money for almost a century. Aftermath of the Revolution -- United States of America were useless. The problem wasn't resolved until 13 years later in 1788 when Congress was granted constitutional powers to coin money and regulate its value. In 1792, the Coinage Act was passed establishing the first national mint which created a national monetary system and unit of money, the dollar. There was also a bimetallic standard, meaning that both silver and gold could be valued in and used to back paper dollars. -- [178]Gold Standard Act was passed, which made gold the sole backing for the dollar. This backing meant that, in theory, you could take your paper money and exchange it for the corresponding value in gold. In 1913, the Federal Reserve was created and given the power to steer the economy by controlling the money supply and interest rates on loans. The Bottom Line -- Money has changed substantially since the days of shells and skins, but its main function hasn't changed at all. Regardless of what form it takes, money offers us a medium of exchange for goods and services and allows the economy to grow as transactions can be completed at greater speeds. -- [206]Paper Money: Definition, History, Use, Need for It, and Examples The physical notes or currency of a country that is used as a medium of exchange is known as paper money.

"With a topic that's so vulnerable, like money, it's important to encourage positive language so people can have positive experiences with their money."

But other opportunities for your money will inevitably arise. And when they do, a sunny day fund could come in handy. What that looks like is up to you.

In that case, keep your sunny -- want a lavish anniversary celebration or plan to eventually take a yearlong sabbatical from work to write a novel — favor a taxable brokerage account.

	<text>Money The money came into existence to overcome the drawbacks of the barter system. Earlier, people use to exchange goods and services as a form of commerce. This often led to many disadvantages, one of which was the double coincidence of wants. To solve this problem, a standard medium of exchange, money, was introduced. What is money? A medium of exchange that is centralized, generally accepted, recognized, and facilitates transactions of goods and services, is known as money. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Money is a medium of exchange for various goods and services in an economy. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh The money system varies with the governments and countries. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh Different countries have different currencies. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh The central authority is responsible for monitoring the monetary system. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh There are many forms of money, and cryptocurrency is the newest addition to the forms of money and can be internationally exchanged. -- should not be used as a currency because it cannot be used multiple times and also cannot be stored for future transactions. Therefore, to conserve the future-oriented use-value of the money, a currency must be durable. Easily recognizable: The users of the money must be ascertained of its authenticity. In other words, the currency must be universally recognized. An unrecognized currency or money leads to disagreement with the exchange terms. A recognized currency ensures trust in the money system as well as its acceptance. Stability: A currency must be stable in terms of value. In simple terms, money should have a constant or increasing value. Money cannot be unstable whose value keeps drastically changing. An unstable currency can give room to the risk of a sudden drop in value which can hamper the acceptance and authenticity of the money system. Portable: A currency must be portable and can be conveniently transported from one place to another. The money must be divisible into various quantities making its use better. Money if not portable can lead to an exceeded cost of transportation of the currency itself. Therefore, money should be able to be divided into further smaller units to facilitate smooth transactions of various quantities of goods. Secondly, it should be easily transferable and portable. -- future payments. Ex- The payment of the electricity bill on the upcoming due date. Store of value: It means that money is capable of being stored and transferring the purchasing power from today to the future. Ex: Using the money in a savings account to buy new furniture. Distribution of social income: Income can easily be distributed with the help of money. Ex: Distribution of total money earned by a school in the form of salaries, wages, utility bills, etc. Basis of Credit Creation: The "store of value" function of the money helps in credit creation by the banks. Ex: Using the money of demand deposits as a tool for credit creation. Liquidity: Money is the most liquid asset of the economy. Ex: Credit cards, debit cards, cash. Types of Money: The following are the types of money: Market Determined Money: Any good that can be generally accepted by the people of the economy to exchange it indirectly for various goods and services between different parties is called Market determined money. Fiat Money and Legal Tender: The form of money that is issued by the government and is not backed by any commodity is known as fiat money. Ex: INR, Dollar, Pounds, etc. The term legal tender states the money that is legally issued by the government. Ex: Coins and Banknotes. Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies are an electronic medium of exchange -- blockchain. In simple terms, it is an intangible form of currency and has opportunities for international exchange. What is the functional definition of money? The functional definition of money states that the money should be capable of bringing a generally accepted medium of exchange, the measure of value, the standard of deferred payment, and a store of value. How many functions of money are there? There are three functions of money: Primary, secondary, and other functions. What is Convertible Virtual Currency? Convertible virtual Currency is used as a substitute for the legal money accepted in the economy. These currencies can easily be exchanged for fiat money like cryptocurrencies.

	<text>Abstract This paper develops a model where money is demanded in excess of spending needs. As a result, money coexists with large availabilities of credit and the model explains the levels of monetary aggregates held in modern economies via the endogenous creation of inside money. At the heart of the model, there is a search friction in the goods market, which generates spare production and spending capacity. As a consequence, there is an endogenous productivity wedge, due to spare production capacity, and an endogenous money velocity, due to spare spending capacity. -- of exchange.” Jevons ([34]1875) An unresolved question in monetary theory is why money coexists with the amount of credit and financial sophistication observed in modern societies. This is a problem because, in monetary theories where a role of money is not assumed ad hoc, credit crowds money out rather quickly. However, advancements in information technology are such that a range of financial arrangements that require information and commitment, such -- notable contributions demonstrated that it is possible to explain some coexistence, monetary equilibrium remains fragile to credit: Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([35]2016) (GMW) find that the value of money and credit taken together cannot exceed that of transactions in a monetary equilibrium, so when there is enough credit to finance all equilibrium transactions, money has no value. This paper develops a model where credit can be larger than transactions and yet money has value. A second contribution is to show that the information and commitment frictions necessary to give money a role can be weak enough to allow for futures contracts through which it is possible to have equilibrium with full insurance. As a consequence of money coexisting with large availabilities of credit, the paper explains the apparently puzzling evidence that, as modern economies go increasingly cashless, more money is held by the private sector. To get a sense of the magnitudes, an aggregate measure of monetary holdings, such as M1, was 2.63 times larger than quarterly -- primary goal of monetary theory. But how to explain these figures? Credit is important here because it expands the monetary base into broader money supply. Therefore, broad money expands as credit becomes more available. However, the credit needed to match the aforementioned monetary aggregates is too large for monetary equilibrium in the existing microfounded models where money demand is not assumed ad hoc, but emerges endogenously as a consequence of deep frictions. This paper develops a model where agents demand liquidity in excess of their spending per capita. As a result, money is valued even when the money stock, or credit availabilities, are in excess of transactions per capita and it becomes possible to match the abovementioned -- spending opportunities are hard to find and it is optimal not to spend all available funds. Money demand emerges as a need to store these unspent funds: the difficulty to spend generates “left over money,” or money as a residual store of value to carry unspent wealth into the future. The paper shows that with this motive, money is demanded even when it is dominated as a transaction means. -- that set-up, the search problem that spending opportunities are hard to find is resolved through an ex post Walrasian market where agents are free to adjust their composition of money and goods. As a result, money is demanded in the Walrasian market for its transaction value in the next period. This paper does not include a frictionless goods market. This absence generates an additional motive to hold money, thanks to which money is demanded even when it is dominated as a transaction means. To demonstrate this, I add a capital good that gives higher return than money and that can be turned into consumption at any time. With such a capital good, money would not be demanded in LW: an agent would leave the Walrasian market with capital and with no money because capital guarantees more consumption in the next period. However, the paper shows that without the Walrasian market, money is held not just for transaction purposes, but also as a consequence of the difficulty to turn liquid assets into goods: the lack of a centralized market makes capital hard to find. As a result, agents demand money to store value even if they prefer capital. So money is held not because it is easier to spend than capital (i.e., for transaction purposes), but because it is easier to acquire. Notice that this does not mean that money cannot then be used for transactions: if this was so, then money would not have value. But the transaction motive alone would not be sufficient to demand money because, as mentioned, agents prefer capital. To paraphrase, money is not demanded in order to make transactions easily, but rather because one does not make transactions easily.[38]1 Relating money and assets, the mechanism offers a resolution to the esteemed rate of return dominance puzzle voiced by Hicks: why money and more remunerative assets coexist? Because money is easier to find (and not because it is easier to spend). As a result, the transaction motive can be minimal, and yet money demand is large and very robust to credit. In particular, the value of money and credit can be larger than income. This way it is possible to match the magnitudes of aggregate monetary holdings. A general equilibrium perspective helps understand why money demand is larger than income: aggregate income equals aggregate spending, but since unmatched agents are not spending their income, matched agents must spend more than their income. And because agents do not know whether they are going to be in a match, everyone wants access to spending power (money + credit) in excess of their income. As a result, even if individual credit is equal to income, money demand is still positive.[39]2 This mechanism is also akin to the Baumol–Tobin (BT) model where an ad -- a liquid asset and goods: recent examples include Alvarez and Lippi ([40]2009), Kaplan and Violante ([41]2014), and Ragot ([42]2014) who emphasize the role of money as a store asset in BT models. One can think of the search friction in this paper as a microfoundation of a resembling portfolio friction. From this perspective, a motivation for -- presence of information frictions and to the ability of the private sector to issue liabilities that play a role as a medium of exchange. As a result, the model speaks to the issue of coexistence of money and financial sophistication.[43]3 -- Kehoe and Levine ([45]1993) and Alvarez and Jermann ([46]2000), and imperfect monitoring. The information assumptions generate the incentives required to sustain some debt and preserve a role for money, see Kocherlakota ([47]1998) and Wallace ([48]2010). Furthermore, the paper shows that through the commitment generated, it is possible to -- hinge on their absence. Quantitatively, the extent to which the model generates large money demand and coexistence with credit depends on the severity of the search friction and in particular, on the probability of finding goods. -- where the liquid asset has no value. Technically, money leads to a lower market tightness (firms over buyers) where the probability of selling goods is higher for firms relative to the nonmonetary equilibrium. So money is desirable because it increases firms' ability to sell, that is, their measured productivity and overall transactions.[54]7 Similarly, inflation erodes the willingness of buyers to hold money; this increases the velocity of money and induces the buyers to choose a market tightness where it is easier for them to find goods, but harder for firms to sell. As a result, inflation leads to a decline in measured aggregate productivity -- particular, a quantitative paper that builds on this theory finds the suggested search mechanism to be a powerful source of recessions: as matching conditions deteriorate, buyers do not spend their money and firms do not sell their goods (surge in liquid savings, spare production capacity, and decline in productivity). This way the model -- Instead, the market for goods is subject to a search friction.[64]9 Besides consumption and capital, there is money: a costlessly storable, divisible and intrinsically useless object. Since this asset is homogeneous, it is not subject to the search friction.

At maturity, bonds clear in money, or by clearance of net bond positions.[71]13 It is shown that, absent a credit limit on the ability to issue such bonds, money has no value. However, a key point of the paper is that the credit necessary for that case is very large. To clarify that the resilience of money to credit does not come from any other missing markets, I also consider an intertemporal bond to roll over any existing debt. This bond is perfectly liquid in the sense that firms are indifferent between it and money. However, it is shown that this bond is not traded in equilibrium. -- that all these contracts are honored under the limited commitment that is enforceable with imperfect monitoring, which is required to make money essential as pointed out by Wallace ([73]2010). These frictions call for a limit on credit and an upper bound on the quantity q sold in a submarket. These two limits enable equilibrium with no endogenous default under the following assumption: to enter a submarket, one has to show proof of means, that is, one has to show enough money holdings and credit availability to afford the purchase in the submarket, should a match occur.[74]14 As in Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([75]2013), I -- frictions, has the same allocation as the neoclassical model, will help isolate the effects of the information frictions in the decentralized economy, and the role of money. From ([85]4), it is also possible to appreciate how the matching -- would be captured by a higher TFP parameter. So in this model, the Solow residual is endogenous.

For recursive equilibria, the aggregate state Ω is composed of the aggregate capital stock K and money M, and possibly of a vector of shocks with a known Markov process. The household solves the following problem with rational expectations: -- shown in ([115]16): the right-hand side shows the end of period balance after insurance, as elaborated earlier. From this latter equation, it is intuitive why money may have value in this economy: [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;ψ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;<lt;<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;1<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$\psi <lt;1$<lt;/annotation>gt; -- can be spent in goods. As formalized later, if B is not too large, the right-hand side of ([116]16) is positive, that is, there is left over wealth, which gives rise to money or bond demand.

Rather, money is demanded because one was not able to make purchases today (store of value motive). This is an important distinction because, as argued next, in this model money is demanded even though it is dominated as a way to acquire goods (i.e., as a transaction means) and so it would not be demanded if it was not -- muted and instead highlight the role of the spending problem, notice that here, if the spending problem was addressed by giving an agent the chance to rebalance her money-goods holdings (similar to an end-of-period centralized market as in LW), she would spend everything to buy goods and leave with -- encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$m^{\prime }=0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] . This is because capital goods pay higher dividends than money and, crucially, they can be consumed at any time.[119]27 This does not mean that money does not have a transaction role: indeed money relaxes the transaction constraint ([120]14) and if it was not so, then money would not have value. But this motive alone would not be sufficient to demand money if an agent had a way to circumvent the spending problem because, as mentioned, agents prefer capital. Instead, in models that have a more prominent transaction role, agents do not turn all money into goods even without the spending problem as is the case in the centralized market in LW. This discussion highlights the importance of the spending friction to induce money demand. However, it should be noticed that households effectively choose the probability of finding goods ψ (and thereby end-of period money holdings) by choosing p and q, which determines market tightness given the equilibrium function [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;θ<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt; -- encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$p_m m^{\prime } \rightarrow 0$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] and they are left with goods only. If households prefer goods to money, why would they willingly choose a low ψ and therefore to hold money?

This portfolio choice is explained in detail next.

Focusing on an interior solution and assuming B independent of p for simplicity, the equation is -- : put differently, the goods constraint ([126]15) with multiplier λ[3] bites more than the financial constraint ([127]16) with multiplier λ[4] so that agents prefer goods to money.

Agents can renege on any of the contracts mentioned above but the commitment is endogenized introducing participation constraints -- that one cannot simply assume perfect firm monitoring. In that case, there would be scope for a firm to become a market maker that collects all the money from the buyers before the matching process, and then use the proceedings to pay the trading posts that are successful. If that was possible, then the market maker could exploit the law of large numbers and ask just enough money to finance the determinisitic number of matches, see Faig and Huangfu ([166]2007). Instead, without the market maker, there is more money demand because buyers can only use their own liquidity in a match and so each buyer needs more money or credit than with the market maker. One final worry is that when the monitoring probability of the households tends to 1, for the incentive -- becomes irrelevant because as per Proposition [167]1, with perfect monitoring, any level of obligation is enforceable. And it is shown later that in such a case, money is not essential. 2 CHARACTERIZATION -- <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] , then the candidate solution is not an equilibrium because the value of money would have to be negative. The strategy above works to the extent that given v, there is a unique -- constructed (because the debt limit need not be the “not too tight” one), there is a nonmonetary equilibrium with the same allocation. In this sense, money is not essential with perfect monitoring, confirming Wallace ([197]2010). Yet, from an empirical perspective, it is interesting that monetary equilibrium can be constructed even with -- <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$q(v)<lt;B$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] and the value of money would have to be negative. Intuitively, money is not demanded if its return is too low, or equivalently, if inflation is too high. So there is an upper limit on inflation, which is tighter the -- <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$v\rightarrow \beta$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] is the Friedman Rule, in which case, inflation is negative and money gives the same return as capital. As a result there is no private cost of not finding goods and holding high liquidity so agents choose a market with low θ and low ψ. Instead, inflation prevents θ from going to its efficient lower bound because it makes it privately costly to hold money. This leads agents to choose markets with higher θ so that there is a higher probability of finding a match and spend the money. However, the higher the matching probability for a buyer, the lower it is for a seller. As shown studying the planning problem, low θ is -- In this model also, velocity is an endogenous function of θ. Indeed the velocity of broad money (i.e., money plus credit such as M1, M2, MZM) in this model is ψ. This is because velocity is defined as output over broad money, which in this model is equal to q. Since production is equal to [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt; -- It is now possible to appreciate better a key point of the paper, that is, the extent to which money is robust to credit. To this aim, it is useful to relate q to income. From equation ([205]16), and using the fact that in equilibrium -- smaller than 1 so that not all agents get to spend, then those in a match must spend more than their income. It follows that, for an equilibrium to exist, agents need spending capacity (money + credit) in excess of their individual income. As a result, money demand is positive even when credit is larger than individual income, but smaller than spending. Notice that this result comes from the general -- <lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$B<lt;q$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] money has value from ([206]14).

An intuition for why money is robust to credit larger than income goes as follows. Because of the search friction, some agents do not buy goods, yet they make income and want a store of value so that they can -- income. In Shi ([210]1997), the big family assumption is such that each family always has income equal to spending. As a result, in these frameworks, credit equal to income is enough for money not to have value. An example An example helps illustrate how useful money is in this economy. From Figure [211]1, it is evident that, given a borrowing limit, monetary equilibrium has higher q and lower v (or higher real interest rate -- , there is no nonmonetary equilibrium because the liquidity provided by credit is insufficient for an equilibrium without the further liquidity provided by money.

To paraphrase the result, liquidity (money + credit) must be sufficiently large to sustain production. The proposition highlights how thirsty of liquidity this economy is. In comparison, in transaction -- The model also has many implications that are in common with the new monetarist approach. In particular, it can be shown that money is neutral but not superneutral, that if B is “lump sum” in the sense that it is independent of the households inputs, then credit has no -- In 2020.II, M1 over quarterly GDP was 2.63; the ratio was 3.62 for either M2 or M3, and 4.19 for MZM. Furthermore, inside money alone (or credit) was larger than GDP. This is because at that time the monetary base (or outside money) was equal to 1.02 times GDP. So inside money measured, for example, through M2, was [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mn>gt;2.6<lt;/mn>gt; <lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mn>gt;3.62<lt;/mn>gt; -- encoding="application/x-tex">gt;$2.6=3.62-1.02$<lt;/annotation>gt; <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] times quarterly GDP.

Since the intertemporal bond is issued by an agent and accepted by an other, -- Review, 76, 1–24. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 1 Generating money holdings through the difficulty to find better assets seems consistent with how Warren Buffett recently justified Berkshire's large cash holdings: in his 2022 annual letter to -- companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.” concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 2 That money is demanded in excess of average spending is akin to the precautionary need for money in Bewley models. However, the mechanism and the implications differ. In precautionary models, there is no search friction in buying goods but agents defer their spending for rainy days. Unlike the precautionary literature, here money is robust to insurance: even redistributing goods and money to insure against the matching risk, still there is money in excess of spending because, owing to the search friction and bilateral trading, each individual must carry the liquidity to make the initial transaction before redistribution can take place. Furthermore, money is robust to the presence of assets that pay higher dividends and that can be instantly turned into consumption. Instead, in Bewley models, it is necessary to give to money the advantage of being more easily turned into goods to buffer idiosyncratic shocks: see Wen ([234]2015) (alternatively, it is -- equilibrium: if the credit limit does not bind, it is possible to pool all liquid assets and those in a match can spend it all, leaving no residual wealth to be stored in money. Under a binding credit limit, those in a match cannot borrow enough to spend all existing liquid assets. -- incentive constraints can also be slack. This way it is possible to move the borrowing limit more freely and test the extent to which money is robust to credit. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 6 It would be also possible to add goods with very little or no search friction at all that are demanded in bounded amounts, such -- still go through. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 7 The ratio of firms over buyers can also be rearranged as the value of supply over demand. So the presence of money increases the demand relative to a nonmonetary equilibrium. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 8 There is a growing literature with search frictions in the goods -- Petrosky-Nadeau and Wasmer ([241]2011), Den Haan ([242]2014), and Ghassibe and Zanetti ([243]2019). The main contribution to this literature is to use that mechanism to construct a theory of money. This way, it is possible to relate TFP to money velocity. Furthermore, Mennuni ([244]2021) shows that disciplining the model through monetary quantities has implications for the identification -- the public record accessible only to a group of the population. I followed the approach of Gu, Mattesini, and Wright ([246]2013) because this way credit is a perfect substitute to money up to the borrowing limit. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 16 Strictly speaking, this constraint holds at each trading post i, -- this is because with the proceedings she may not buy back goods for the same amount given the search friction, and would hold the rest in money, which pays lower return. A household would be willing to sell in a submarket with a higher price than the one at which she buys, but (in the representative agent environment that follows -- no scope for further exchanges after those prescribed in the insurance scheme. This is because after insurance, agents that like the same variety value capital and money in the same way and have the same amount of both. So, unless the optimal quantity of money and capital is indeterminate because agents are indifferent between many allocations, they would want to exit the market with the same -- allocations can be ruled out because, as shown later, the budget set is convex and preferences are strictly concave so agents have a unique optimum quantity of money and capital in an equilibrium. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 23 Submarkets are only indexed with p rather than with [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;mrow>gt; <lt;mi>gt;p<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;mi>gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;/mrow>gt; -- bonds to be in positive supply, they would have to be a liability of the government. But since there is no liquidity difference, the distinction between money and government bonds would be intangible. This can also be appreciated by the first-order conditions for [MATH: <lt;semantics>gt; <lt;msup>gt; <lt;mi>gt;m<lt;/mi>gt; <lt;mo>gt;′<lt;/mo>gt; <lt;/msup>gt; <lt;annotation -- <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] in Appendix [256]B; they imply an arbitrage Fisher equation that pins down v so that money and bonds pay the same return. It would be possible to relax the assumption of perfect substitutability and distinguish between money and government bonds by assuming a mild search friction for bonds. The intertemporal bond highlights that this theory of money does not rely on the fact that agents are not allowed intertemporal credit. In fact, without insurance, the bond would be traded but it would still be in aggregate zero net supply, thus leaving space for money demand to store the remaining unmatched aggregate savings. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 26 It could be argued that in real life one can invest unspent -- everyone. Furthermore, if one buys shares of firms who hold cash (or who hold shares of other firms who hold cash), one is holding cash. In this model, agents hold either money or capital directly, but one could conceive other decentralizations where firms hold capital and money, and issue shares. To make shares less liquid than money, one could assume a mild search friction on shares. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 27 Capital is introduced in an LW model in GMW, but agents are not allowed to consume it or trade it in the decentralized market. Lagos and Rocheteau ([257]2008) find conditions under which coexistence of money and capital is possible even when capital can be used for transactions in the decentralized market. However, they assume that capital cannot be directly consumed in the decentralized market. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 28 In a transaction framework, those are all the effects so that agents must be at the margin indifferent between goods and money in a centralized market. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 29 Without this assumption, a firm could open many trading posts -- <lt;/semantics>gt; :MATH] , ([268]B3) and ([269]B4), imply an arbitrage condition: because bonds and money are equally liquid, they must give the same real return. In steady state, the real interest rate on bonds equals the inflation rate -- . This is a Fisher equation with the addition that, owing to the perfect substitutability between m and b, the nominal interest rate is infinitely elastic at 0. By governing money growth, the government sets inflation and v. Equivalently the government can set a policy for v and let money supply accommodate money demand. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 33 The latter condition implies that the equilibrium p is normalized to 1. -- to make m fully observable would require more information than showing proof of means: one thing is to show one has a given amount of money, another is to prove that that is all the money one has. concordancier.sh creation_tableaux.sh make_itrameur_corpus.sh 35 This is because q is increasing in θ so the constraint on q also restricts θ.</text>

	<text>Money may make the world go around, as the song says. And most people in the world probably have handled money, many of them on a daily basis. But despite its familiarity, probably few people could tell you exactly what money is, or how it works. In short, money can be anything that can serve as a • store of value, which means people can save it and use it later—smoothing their purchases over time; -- IFRAME: [18]http://www.youtube.com/embed/FpMB0Qhnp7E Perhaps the easiest way to think about the role of money is to consider what would change if we did not have it. If there were no money, we would be reduced to a barter economy. Every item someone wanted to purchase would have to be exchanged for something that person could provide. For example, a person who -- person with whom to barter. But with money, you don’t need to find a particular person. You just need a market in which to sell your goods or services. In that market, you don’t barter for individual goods. Instead you exchange your goods or services for a common medium of exchange—that is, money. You can then use that money to buy what you need from others who also accept the same medium of exchange. As people become more specialized, it is easier to produce more, which leads to more demand for transactions and, hence, more demand for money. [19][FDPromoImage.jpg] Many monies To put it a different way, money is something that holds its value over time, can be easily translated into prices, and is widely accepted. Many different things have been used as money over the years—among them, cowry shells, barley, peppercorns, gold, and silver. At first, the value of money was anchored by its alternative uses, and the fact that there were replacement costs. For example, you could eat barley or use peppercorns to flavor food. The value you place on such consumption provides a floor for the value. Anyone could grow more, but it does take time, so if the barley is eaten the supply of money declines. On the other hand, many people may want strawberries and be happy to trade for them, but they make poor money because they are perishable. They are difficult to save for use next month, let alone next year, and almost impossible to use in trade with people far away. -- example, the value of a basket of strawberries measured against different items is not easy to establish and keep constant. Not only do strawberries make for bad money, most things do. But precious metals seemed to serve all three needs: a stable unit of -- coins and do not lose value when made into smaller units. In short, their durability, limited supply, high replacement cost, and portability made precious metals more attractive as money than other goods. -- precious metal that backs the note. Eventually, the paper claim on the precious metal was delinked from the metal. When that link was broken, fiat money was born. Fiat money is materially worthless, but has value simply because a nation collectively agrees to ascribe a value to it. In short, money works because people believe that it will. As the means of exchange evolved, so did its source—from individuals in barter, to some sort of collective acceptance when money was barley or shells, to governments in more recent times. Even though using standardized coins or paper bills made it easier to determine prices of goods and services, the amount of money in the system also played an important role in setting prices. For example, a wheat farmer would have at least two reasons for holding money: to use in transactions (cash in advance) and as a buffer against future needs (precautionary saving). Suppose winter is coming and the farmer wants to add to his store of money in anticipation of future expenses. If the farmer has a hard time finding people with money who want to buy wheat, he may have to accept fewer coins or bills in exchange for the grain. The result is that the price of wheat goes down because the supply of money is too tight. One reason might be that there just isn’t enough gold to mint new money. When prices as a whole go down, it is called deflation. On the other hand, if there is more money in circulation but the same level of demand for goods, the value of the money will drop. This is inflation—when it takes more money to get the same amount of goods and services (see “[20]What Is Inflation?” in the March 2010 issue of F&amp;D). Keeping the demand for and supply of money balanced can be tricky. Manufacturing money How money is measured Fiat money is more efficient to use than precious metals. Adjustments to its supply do not depend on the amount of precious metal around. But that adds its own complication: Precisely because there is a finite amount of precious metals, there is a limit on the amount of notes that can be issued. If there is no gold or silver to back money, how do governments know how much to print? That gets into the dilemmas governments face. On the one hand, the authorities will always be tempted to issue money, because governments can buy more with it, hire more people, pay more wages, and increase their popularity. On the other hand, printing too much money starts to push up prices. If people start expecting that prices will continue to rise, they may increase their own prices even faster. Unless the government acts to rein in expectations, trust in money will be eroded, and it may eventually become worthless. That is what happens during hyperinflation. To remove this temptation to print money willy-nilly, most countries today have delegated the task of deciding how much money to print to independent central banks, which are charged with making the call based on their assessment of the economy’s needs and do not transfer funds to the government to finance its spending (see “[21]What Is Monetary Policy?” in the September 2009 issue of F&amp;D). The term “printing money” is something of a misnomer in itself. Most money today is in the form of bank deposits rather than paper currency (see box). -- Countries that have been down the path of high inflation experienced firsthand how the value of money essentially depends on people believing in it. In the 1980s, people in some Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, gradually lost confidence in the -- started using a more stable one, the U.S. dollar, as the de facto currency. This phenomenon is called unofficial, or de facto, dollarization. The government loses its monopoly on issuing money—and dollarization can be very difficult to reverse. Some policies governments have used to restore confidence in a currency nicely highlight the “faith” part of money functioning. In Turkey, for example, the government rebased the currency, the lira, eliminating six zeros in 2005. Overnight, 1,000,000 liras became 1 lira. Brazil, on the -- countries, citizens went along, demonstrating that as long as everyone accepts that a different denomination or a new currency is the norm, it simply will be. Just like fiat money. If it is accepted as money, it is money. ■ Irena Asmundson and Ceyda Oner are Economists in the IMF’s Strategy,</text>

	<text>Hello, I have some saving accounts in France and I do have to fill up a self assessment in order to pay my taxes on the interests in the UK. If I wanted to transfer some money from my French bank account to my English bank account, do I have to declare or mention it somewhere? Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of money I am transferring to the Uk? And what is the maximum amount I can transfer in one go? Thank you -- Posted Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:14:45 GMT by [24]Joe Kycheto I’m a Canadian citizen, resident in the UK and wish to transfer monies from Canada to the UK. The money was left to me by my late mother and relevant taxes have been paid in Canada. It’s not income so I can’t see that I’d need to pay income tax on the UK on it ? Would this be correct -- from Singapore, I would like to ask some questions and hope somebody can give me some suggestions: (1) As a non-UK citizen, could I use the borrowed money for the property purchase? (cash buyer) (2) If I can use the borrowed money for the property purchase, do I need to declare the large money transaction with HMRC? Like tax paying. Big thanks [29]HMRC Admin 5 Posted Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:28:01 GMT by [30]HMRC Admin 5 -- For income tax purposes, you do not need to notify us of your Capital your bank account or if you transfer your money to a UK account. Thank You. [35]Konstantinos Tsitsilonis Posted Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:44:03 GMT by [36]Konstantinos Tsitsilonis Good morning. My father who has a savings account in one UK bank is planning on transfering money to my account in another UK bank, and neither of these accounts are joint accounts (I am not in his accound and he is not in mine). Will he or myself have to pay any taxes on that transfer? If so, is there a limit in the money transfered above which I will get taxed? Thanks for your help in advance. [37]D0minika Posted Fri, 05 Mar 2021 18:46:34 GMT by [38]D0minika Hi My friends based in France want to send me some money to UK. Is there a limit and do I need to declare it? Answer -- Hello - I moved to the UK just over five months ago. I've been renting an apartment with my wife and children since November. And working for a UK-based company since Oct. I have money held in a foreign account and would like to transfer the sums into my UK accounts. Do I need to notify HMRC about this transfer? This is money I have saved from previous jobs before moving to the UK. Thank you. [46]HMRC Admin 20 -- [52]rrobotx1 Posted Fri, 12 Mar 2021 07:26:03 GMT by [53]rrobotx1 Hello, I am just arrived at the UK. I am arranging to move money from my overseas accounts to the UK. Part of the money moving in will be used towards the purchase of a residential house for my son in the UK. He is currently a non-resident and will be a tax-resident in the year 2021-2022. Need my son or I pay UK tax for the money transfer? Does it require for any declaration of the transfer to the HMRC? Will there be any difference if the money transfer between our accounts (UK accounts) occur before and after financial year cut-off of 5April2021? Thank you. [54]HMRC Admin 17</text>

Using the fact that most people who use Betfair have no idea what they are doing, users of Betfair Scalper will be able to set ‘traps’ to manipulate where the money is going, and then consistently make multiple profits throughout the day, without anybody even noticing. What you will be doing, is scalping, or creaming a percentage of the money being placed BEFORE an event has even taken place. How does Betfair Scalper work? -- definitely before the race begins. Scalping is quite a relaxed way of making money compared to many of the systems out there. It is simply a case of time that you have to invest after you learn how it is done. -- £89.97 – Although when considering how much the investment is, as always, you will need to weigh up the earning potential of what is being offered, as well as the money back guarantee offered by the vendor.

I have read a lot over the years about how to make money from betfair but this really ticked the right boxes on what to actually do. I am not trading live yet as I am still practising but if you are interested in a proper -- I bought this today and there is a lot of stuff to watch and read, outstanding amount of content for the money. I am looking forward to geting stuck in, and will let you know how I -- Coming from match betting this was good for me as all my bonuses were drying up and finding it harder to make money. This scalping course has been excellent so far. I started it the last week in feb and starting to make some consistent profits already.

	<text>Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of my frugal lifestyle. I don't contribute much to it because I don't spend lots of money.

Stocks and bonds aren't contribution to the economy, they are tools to build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual work. As opposed to contributing to the economy by working for money as a means of transaction to be spent elsewhere. Which is exactly what is stimulating the economy. -- build wealth from already existing wealth without doing the actual work.

For example an aggregate bond fund will hold a variety of debts, including corporate debt and securitized debts. So buying bonds will both lend money to corporations (allowing them to function) and even buys pools of securitized consumer debts, all kinds of things like credit card debts, auto loans, etc. -- Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of my frugal lifestyle.

Whereas the economic "contribution" of #2 is about balancing the use of the tools (capital &amp; debt), because we need an equilibrium between the lenders of money and the borrowers of money, so having too much money saved (invested) ends up being bad for the current economic system because that means too many lenders (those who save), not enough borrowers (those who spend). Whereas in #1, contribution to the economy by spending more is always good for the economy (the bad happens from the tools of #2, when money is added to the economy, when more debt is created, but if the amount of money was fixed it wouldn't be an issue, inflation would strictly come from the velocity of money, nothing else).

Interestingly you forgot about defense.

If people invest or save the money there is no bump to the economy and it is referred to by central bankers as "dead money". If everyone was frugal to the extreme there would be fewer companies and employees and the economy would shrink and enter a recession. -- services (jobs) when consumer demand warrants it.

When the government gives people money, it causes an temporary bump, which gets paid back later when they pay off the debt. or they make it systemic, and it pushes up inflation. The thing is that money should represent work, or value, and if they just put out more, it's call inflation, but really what they mean is they're discounting the value of the work you did. -- Now, sometimes I like to say that I'm boycotting the economy because of my frugal lifestyle.

Unless you keep your savings in cash under the mattress, the actions of buying stocks, bonds or having cash in a bank account are contributing -- mulitiplier effect (I cannot remember the exact term). Types of spending have impacts on the economy. Consumer spending has a multiplier of CX (can't remember), as the money passes hands to a number of people (from the suppliers, to manufacturers, to retailers, etc) within that system. Government spending also has another multiplier of GX (I only remember it's higher than CX). Savings and Investment have a different impact as it takes out the money out of the economy. A bank that pays you interest that they lend out the money for someone to buy something has both a negative effect (taking out the buying power of the person borrowing the money, and the person saving is not spending), and a positive of effect of someone buying the item with but the multiplier is now lower. -- [187]MrBlackhill said: Yet the money that I don't spend actually goes into investments...

Because spending has a much greater effect than saving. Imagine the situation where most people were saving money and barely spending vs if most people were spending money and barely saving.

Keep in mind when people talk about saving, it's more about putting money into the bank rather than buying money into stocks or corporate bonds. By reducing the prime to minimal levels, it encourages people to put their money in other places rather than sticking money in the bank where it doesn't circulate in the economy. Rather than looking at the safety of the banks or GICs, people would be encouraged to find other -- the "guaranteed, can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of looking into investing in companies. -- can't lose" real estate as the alternative, so now we're getting into the housing bubble. Of course, while this perception exists, people are just going to keep pouring money into RE instead of looking into investing in companies. Click to expand... Yes I think so too. And all that money into real estate is very unproductive. It's a terrible misallocation of capital IMO. I suspect that we will be paying the consequences for several decades. -- Visible links: 1. https://www.canadianmoneyforum.com/threads/investing-vs-contributing-to-the-economy.145516/page-2 2.
